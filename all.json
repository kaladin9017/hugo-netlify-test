Several studies have suggested that [practicing mindfulness](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/this-is-how-you-find-calm-in-the-chaos/) can reduce prejudice and bias.\n\nFor example, [one study](http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-9335/a000212?journalCode=zsp) found that a brief loving-kindness meditation reduced prejudice toward homeless people, while [another](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bryan_Gibson2/publication/294276984_Brief_Mindfulness_Meditation_Reduces_Discrimination/links/570baaf508aee06603519a68.pdf) found that a brief mindfulness training decreased unconscious bias against black people and elderly people. In a [third study](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2016-06826-001) by Adam Lueke and colleagues, white participants who received a brief mindfulness training demonstrated less biased behavior (not just attitudes) toward black participants in a trust game.\n\n“We see a general trend to treat people without preconceived notions—in a more fair and balanced way—after practicing mindfulness,” Lueke says.\n\nBut how does mindfulness have this impact? This is a crucial question, if we want to design activities and programs to help people bridge their differences, and to understand our own personal obstacles. \n\nA flurry of recent studies are starting to explore this, and they support the idea that mindfulness may target prejudice indirectly, by lessening our cognitive biases—automatic, systematic errors in our thinking—in ways that impact our judgments of other people. By reducing our susceptibility to cognitive biases, mindfulness could play a role in [improving social relationships](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-you-can-make-an-impact-on-a-strangers-life/) in our society.\n\n## 1. Mindfulness helps us see the full context for people’s actions\n\n![Judge](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1HhiafBMJOYIo6wqCYM44Y/b115da29ee3eb9c1612818b5bcdf716a/shutterstock_613752935.jpg)\n\nHumans have a natural tendency to see other people's actionas as reflective of stable character traits rather than external factors. So if a student doesn’t pass his math test, you may decide he’s not good at math or lazy, rather than thinking that he didn’t get a good night’s sleep.\n\nThis tendency to ignore circumstances is called the correspondence bias, and it impacts how we judge people, including people of different social groups.\n\n> Humans have a natural tendency to see other people's actionas as reflective of stable character traits.\n> \n\nIt’s easy to see how this plays out in real life. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, many white Americans assumed the residents who stayed were stubborn, rather than simply too poor to evacuate. Research also suggests that this bias plays a role in the courtroom, where juries often [dismiss mitigating circumstances when assigning punishment](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1068316X.2016.1258473?journalCode=gpcl20), especially for people of color.\n\nBut mindfulness can help us fight this tendency in ourselves.\n\nIn a [recent study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2016.1149498?journalCode=pqje20) by Tim Hopthrow and colleagues, participants were divided into three groups and given either a brief mindful eating exercise, a task that required them to pay attention to detail, or neither (serving as a control). Afterwards, the participants read an essay that was either pro- or anti-nuclear power, with the understanding that the writer hadn’t chosen their position—it was assigned. They then rated how strongly they believed the writer was for or against nuclear power.\n\n> This bias plays a role in the courtroom, where juries often dismiss mitigating circumstances when assigning punishment, especially for people of color.\n> \n\nResults showed that participants in the mindfulness group were significantly less willing to equate the position taken in the writer’s essay with their true beliefs than those in the other two groups. In other words, they were less likely to fall prey to the correspondence bias.\n\nThese results suggest that mindfulness could play a role in decreasing a bias that we use to pigeonhole people, which could benefit all social relationships, but particularly cross-group interactions.\n\nWhen we understand that someone may be acting in a certain way because of pressures they face or situations they find themselves in—rather than personal attributes—we may be more empathic and better able to bridge misunderstandings that arise between us.\n\n## 2. Mindfulness helps us decrease our negativity bias\n\nMost of us naturally pay more attention to and react more strongly to negative events than positive events in our lives—a phenomenon called the negativity bias. This is due to our early evolutionary history, where being vigilant counted heavily for our survival.\n\nHaving a strong negativity bias can make us extra cautious about entering situations where we anticipate that something bad might happen. And [research shows](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/vpvaughns/assets/pdfs/Sensitivity%20to%20Status-Based%20Rejection%20(2002).pdf) that interactions with people from different social groups can be stressful, in part because we worry about being rejected—a strongly negative experience for most people. For those with high negativity bias, fear of rejection is even more of a barrier. \n\nBut mindfulness can help reduce our negativity bias and consequently help us to be less wary of negative social encounters. Support for this claim comes from experiments looking at how mindfulness impacts our emotional reactivity to negative stimuli.\n\n> Mindfulness can help reduce our negativity bias.\n> \n\nIn one study, researchers studied how mindfulness affected participant [brain activity](https://brainlang.georgetown.edu/research/erplab). Participants reported on their general mindfulness levels, then briefly viewed photos that induced strong positive emotion (like photos of babies), strong negative emotion (like photos of people in pain), or neither while having their brains scanned.\n\nMore mindful participants were less reactive to negative photos and showed higher indications of positive feeling when seeing the positive photos. This was assessed via brain patterns associated with reactions to distress. According to the authors, this supports the contention that mindfulness decreases the negativity bias—something other [studies](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550610396585) support, too.\n\nIn [another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23563850), some participants in an fMRI machine were given a short mindfulness instruction—to “consciously be aware of yourself, of what happens to you at this moment,” without judgment—before being told to expect photos depicting negative events, and then seeing the photos. Those who’d received mindfulness instruction showed increased activation in the prefrontal cortex of the brain and decreased activity in the amygdala—a pattern associated with less emotional reactivity—before seeing the photos and while seeing them. This suggests that even a short mindfulness teaching may help people handle [anxiety-inducing experiences](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-manage-your-anxiety/) in a healthier way.\n\nAnd that includes negative social situations. In one study, participants reported on their fear of being ostracized in social encounters, self-esteem, and mindfulness levels. The researchers found that although participants with low self-esteem had a greater fear of being rejected, being more mindful decreased those effects.\n\nTaken together, these studies suggest that mindfulness can decrease our emotional reactivity to negative events, potentially leading to less social friction in more uncertain, anxiety-producing situations.\n\n## 3. Mindfulness may help us see others as equals\n\nAnother common psychological bias is the self-positivity bias: the need to hold onto positive views of ourselves in comparison to others. This can sometimes lead us to want to put others down to make ourselves look good. The self-positivity bias is at work when we assume that our boss’s critique of our workgroup’s project has nothing to do with us, for example.\n\n![Judgy](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/a3Yuja3aCsMS44u0K6YY2/054dd3a63e492accec423d932929d18c/shutterstock_592979069.jpg)\n\nBut in at least [one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-014-0317-z), mindfulness has been shown to decrease the self-positivity bias, suggesting another way it could be useful to our social relationships.\n\nHere, participants received either a 15-minute talk on the benefits of mindfulness, 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation, or 15 minutes of loving-kindness meditation. Then, participants viewed photos of themselves or of strangers and had to pair the photos with either positive or negative words, depending on the instructions they were given. Self-positivity bias was measured by how easily they associated themselves with positive words and strangers with negative words.\n\nResults showed that the people who practiced either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation showed less self-positivity bias than the group who simply learned about the benefits of mindfulness.\n\nThough this research is still relatively preliminary, [others](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=defBAAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA49&dq=+mindfulness+and+self+other&ots=61BP_sSosa&sig=L_hBRd-ZhAcDqComE4eFNTO825s#v=onepage&q=mindfulness%252520and%252520self%252520other&f=false) have made the case that mindfulness helps us to keep a strong sense of self while also increasing our empathy with and care for those who are different—something you’d expect of people with low self-positivity bias. In fact, these and other benefits of mindfulness training have led some to suggest that attorneys and doctors consider mindfulness practices as part of the solution for reducing implicit biases they may have toward clients and patients.\n\nWhile it’s clear that mindfulness impacts our personal well-being, it’s becoming clearer how it may also influence our social well-being. By reducing the correspondence bias, negativity bias, and self-positivity bias, mindfulness can help us have better relationships with others—including those who look and behave differently.\n\n> While it’s clear that mindfulness impacts our personal well-being, it’s becoming clearer how it may also influence our social well-being.\n> \n\nGiven how defensive people can be about receiving training to reduce racism, Lueke believes teaching mindfulness in general may be particularly useful. If mindfulness training has these benefits without actually targeting bias directly, it might be more palatable than specific bias reduction programs, he says.\n\n“If you tell people that they’re prejudiced and racist, and that you’re going to try to fix that, people become defensive,” he says. “The fact that mindfulness is not specifically targeted toward reducing discrimination—and that it carries all these personal benefits, like less stress, greater life satisfaction, etc.—is very positive, because people won’t have their guards up.”\n\nPerhaps if we want to get along better, we could do worse than starting with mindfulness.

I also have approval seeking tendencies that leave me feeling upset, used, restless, and irritated.\n\nYou're not supposed to know this. You're not supposed to know any of this. As a Black male, I was told to keep these details to myself. Then again, a lot of people don't share things like this - regardless of their ethnic/racial background. We don't want to appear broken, less than, or be discriminated against. A lot of us feel like this even when we don't tell anyone. \n\n> So many people suffer in silence. Many don't have the language for what they're experiencing, and might not even seek help if they had the options.\n\nWe don't want to be pushed out or left behind. We want to get the job we want, discover our calling in life, impress the date we met online, have the friends we desire, and be treated with dignity and respect. It's risky to divulge the messy details about ourselves. We fear losing everything that we've worked for and in some cases, sharing our darker truths can cause us to lose family, friends, and opportunities. The stigma is real. \n\nSo many people suffer in silence. Many don't have the language for what they're experiencing, and might not even seek help if they had the options.\n\nTherefore, it's necessary for me to share my story. Others are sharing their stories, for example, [This is My Brave](https://thisismybrave.org/), [The Committed Project](http://thecommittedproject.org/), and [The Buddy Project.](http://www.buddy-project.org/) I'm glad to be at a place in my life where I can be open and honest. I hope to inspire someone else to seek the support they've been needing.\n\nHere is some insight into what my process has been like. \n\nI recently started seeing a new counselor. He has a history of helping people recover from alcohol/drug addiction. He teaches at a university, identifies as a Black geek, and has a lot in common with me. My therapist also checks his email and text messages during my session, to which he always regretfully apologizes. Don't worry, I'm going to saying something about this during my next visit. I secretly think he's trying to help me work on my people pleasing issues.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, my therapist is amazing. He gets me. His practice is built on acceptance and it feels authentic when he provides it.\n\nMy therapist often pushes back on me. He's real with me and doesn't sugarcoat anything. Last week, we talked about how approval doesn't equate to effectiveness. Meaning: my impact can still matter even if no one says it does. I'm still processing this as it's one of my major areas of growth. But, I'm glad to be working through it with someone who will hold me accountable. \n\nThe sessions have been good. They help me get outside of thoughts that tell me that I'm unworthy. I get guidance with being [less fearful](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/). I receive tools to help me navigate a depression that tells me there's no reason or meaning to any of this. Yeah, it get's real. I've had days where I don’t want to leave my bed. I've had moments where I can't even send an email, make dinner, or start my car. I live with trauma and irrational thoughts. I battle them. I go into the dark places, and face ugly things. \n\nBut, while my scars are unique, they're not bad. I'm not alone. Therapy has taught me that I'm strong and resilient. Talking about my struggles has shown me that there are so many who struggle like I do - and even worse as well. It can be heavy to hear their stories, but I try to remember that they are intelligent, zestful, worthy, and powerful. While their pain is very real, it is not all of who they are. The same is true for me. I don't begin or end at my illnesses. Neither do you.\n\n> I fail. You fail. It happens. But failure doesn't make you a loser; it makes you human. \n\nI've been going to therapy since I was a sophomore in college, and I'm so thankful I made that first intake appointment. It took me a while to find a therapist I felt comfortable with, but once I did, things started to improve. I learned that doing the homework they assigned helped me in my healing. I learned that healing is a non-linear and life-long process. I learned that I can feel safe in most places. I learned to breathe deeply. \n\nThere are things I do between sessions to stay mentally healthy in addition to journaling (infrequently), prayer, and spending time with friends. \n\n[Going to the gym](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/) and attending my weekly hip-hop dance class help me get out of my head and into my body. There's all types of research around why we feel better when we move (which you can Google), but I'll just say I feel darn good when I push myself while running, lifting, or dancing. The challenging part is when the thoughts kick in: \"You don't have to workout today, take a break!\" or \"Why are you doing so much? Just sit down somewhere!\"\n\nHonestly, I've given into these thoughts plenty of times. I fail. You fail. It happens. But failure doesn't make you a loser; it makes you human. \n\nSometimes I end up staying in bed and skipping the gym. Sometimes I'm up late eating pizza, fries, chips, or anything else with carbs. Sometimes, I convince myself that I'll never lose weight, and that working out is a complete waste of time. I can be really hard on myself and say really mean things to myself. My body will tense up and sleep is a challenge on those nights.\n\nMy mental wellness suffers in these moments. It's all connected. Which is why - on my best days - I take a holistic approach. On my worst days, I just do nothing and feel like crap. \n\nBut, doing nothing isn't always a bad thing. Stillness and [mindfulness](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/three-ways-mindfulness-can-make-you-less-biased/) have been another part of my healing. I talked about being present in last week's email, and I'm thankful for the Headspace app. It's guided meditation designed for the everyday person, and it's been working for me.\n\n> I think it's important to acknowledge the wins and losses. The good days and the bad days. The times you beat fear and the times fear wins.\n\nI try to use it before bed each night, but that doesn't always happen. Some days, I'll go into our home office and I'll sit at my desk, close my eyes, and get present with my thoughts. This used to be really difficult, but I've gotten much better at being non-judgmental towards my thoughts. Again, I'm not perfect at doing any of this. There are days when I throw all the positivity and healthy stuff out the window. I think it's about drinking in those moments of hopefulness, and noticing that we get to have them. \n\nFor me, that's been the most impactful part of this entire mental health journey. There are many reasons why I have the symptoms and issues I do. Things weren't always nurturing and loving growing up. I didn't often have times where I felt I could just relax and be comfortable in my own skin. So, having peaceful moments these days has been a real blessing and delight. It's up to me to notice the good in my life, the work I've done, and the obstacles to mental wellness I conquer.\n\nI think it's important to acknowledge the wins and losses. The good days and the bad days. The times you beat fear and the times fear wins. Whether you're seeing a therapist, about to go on medication, you love someone with a mental illness, or you don't know what's going on with you, know that there's support out here. \n\nKnow that I'm in this fight too, and I'm tripping over myself every day and trying to figure this life thing out. It's not easy, but I'm not giving up.\n\nAnd, I'm not going to stop telling my story until the stigma is gone.\n\n[READ NEXT: How I Stopped Comparing Myself](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-this-shine-squad-member-stopped-comparing-himself-to-others/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Enough Today Header","description":"enough today","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4dVsAe6sso0CyWUaqsesCC/911c016d0f5a807aa38c4f7fb8956b6b/13920358_869585881572_2559845112060255017_o.jpg","details":{"size":116683,"image":{"width":1365,"height":1365}},"fileName":"13920358_869585881572_2559845112060255017_o.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Sinclair Ceasar","bio":"<p>Sinclair Ceasar is an Assistant Director of Student Life at Loyola University Maryland.

Most of us think about rest as merely the absence of work—not something valuable in its own right. Sometimes, it’s even equated with laziness.\n\nBut nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nRest is an essential component of working well and working smart. In my new book, *[Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465074871?ie=UTF8&tag=gregooscicen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465074871)*, I outline some of the fascinating research that shows how rest helps us to think, innovate, and increase our productivity, and what we can do to rest more effectively.\n\n> Everyone basically knows how rest, but with a little work and understanding, you can learn to do it a lot better.\n> \n\nEven in our brain’s resting state—when we are not directly focused on a task—it’s still active, engaging its “[default network](https://cerpp.usc.edu/files/2013/11/Immordino-YangetalRESTISNOTIDLENESSPPS2012.pdf)” to plug away at problems, examine and toss out possible answers, and look for new information. We may not be able to control these processes completely; but by learning to rest better, we can support them, let them work, and take notice when they uncover something that deserves our attention.\n\nThink of rest as akin to sex or singing or running. Everyone basically knows how to do it, but with a little work and understanding, you can learn to do it a lot better. You can enjoy rest more profoundly and be more refreshed and restored if you simply work at it a bit more.\n\nHere are some of the ways I recommend using rest to benefit your thinking and creativity.\n\n## 1. Starting an early morning routine\n\nWhile some writers and artists burn the midnight oil, depend on a looming deadline to help them focus, or wait for inspiration to strike before getting down to business, many of history’s most creative and prolific figures take a different approach. \n\nThey start work earlier, sometimes before dawn, and concentrate on their most challenging work first when their creative energy is bound to be at its peak. They also tend to set up routines, so that they don’t waste brainpower recreating the wheel every day and taking up valuable creative energy.\n\n![buying coffee](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2YvYZkH6rKEIYSemwOugkc/e66d2ca07a4c437358da721886d3da91/buying_coffee.jpg)\n\nWe may think of routine as the opposite of creativity; but in reality, research suggests that routines can enhance it. In [one study](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/10582;jsessionid=6D5786B7914DA0D087504F755089B790), researchers surveyed hundreds of workers at a high-tech company about how much routine they had in their everyday work, how much opportunity they had to be creative on the job, and how much initiative they could exercise in trying out new ideas. \n\nThen, they looked at how many creative ideas these workers submitted to managers. They found that employees whose work had a large measure of routine were more likely to submit ideas; those who had more control over their work did even better.\n\n## 2. Walking\n\nWalking can be a simple way to facilitate creative thinking. Not only is it a form of exercise (which brings blood to the brain), it can also help our brains engage in a light kind of focus, which __encourages more mind-wandering and aids later creativity__.\nResearchers at Stanford did a [series of experiments](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf) looking at the effects of walking on creativity, as measured by a test of divergent thinking—which asks people to come up with novel ways of using an everyday item, like a brick or a doorstop. \n\nThe researchers compared participants’ performance under four conditions: while walking on a treadmill, while seated inside, while walking outside, or while being wheeled outside in a wheelchair.\n\nTheir results showed that walking and being outside each separately led to better performance on the test. Moreover, in one experiment, the researchers showed that the benefits of walking on creativity did not fade immediately, but carried over into performance on future tests.\n\nWalking may not be as beneficial for focused, analytical thinking; but there’s good reason to believe that it stimulates creativity and may aid you in solving problems encountered on the job, particularly if you walk when problems are still fresh in your mind. For naturalist Charles Darwin, for example, walking was so valuable a creative stimulus that he built a “[thinking path](http://www.askpang.com/2016/11/visit-to-charles-darwins-down-house.html)” near his house, and would retreat to it while working on difficult problems.\n\n## 3. Napping\n\nIf you do imaginative, creative work over long hours or in a demanding environment, afternoon naps can have restorative power for you. Sleep scientists have found that even a short nap can be effective in recharging your mental batteries.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of napping is that it [increases alertness](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00718.x/full) and decreases fatigue. Even a short nap of around 20 minutes boosts your ability to concentrate by giving your brain a chance to restore depleted energy.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-10-18 at 8.41.35 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6wa7tYPZeMsAyyyaUYoMoS/d35536f4f0fe02355e34654b58ab50a6/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.41.35_AM.png)\n\n[In one study](https://www.saramednick.com/htmls/pdfs/Mednick-NN03%5B8%5D.pdf), Sara Mednick and colleagues tested participants on perception tasks—similar to what you do to get your peripheral vision checked—then divided them into three groups: one that didn’t nap at all, and two that napped either for an hour or ninety minutes. Everyone was then re-tested in the evening. \n\nThose who hadn’t napped performed worse in the evening, while those who’d napped either performed the same or dramatically better. Testing all of the groups the next day—after a night’s sleep—still resulted in “nappers” doing better than “non-nappers,” suggesting that naps augment the positive effects of sleep.\n\n> All of the research points to the importance of rest in our fast-paced lives.\n> \n\nMednick’s research also implies that napping may improve performance on certain tasks more than caffeine. You can even vary the timing of your nap to get different benefits: An earlier nap will give you more REM sleep and boost creativity, while a later nap will be richer in slow-wave sleep and more physically restorative. All this is to say that taking a nap may be a good way to boost your performance and creativity.\n\n## 4. Stopping at the right time\n\nWhile many of us may feel that pushing ourselves to work long, unbroken hours is the best way to be productive, [science suggests otherwise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990058/). In fact, working longer may lead to stress, burnout, disengagement from work, and poorer performance on the job. It can also kill creativity and innovation.\n\nA counterintuitive but effective form of deliberate rest is to stop working at just the right point: when you see your next move, but decide to leave it until tomorrow. Ernest Hemingway was a famous advocate of the practice, and many notable writers have followed his advice to “[always stop when you know what is going to happen next](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway).”\n\n![love dog](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/34KsI6HsHeCmWSwiKwUYCK/07716ac5ec9bc5af991498dab45c13e7/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.56.44_AM.png)\n\n\nStopping when you have a little energy left makes it easier to get started the next day. It also seems to prompt your subconscious mind to tackle work problems in the meantime, suggesting that Hemingway’s intuition was correct.\n\nIn [one study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2012.677282), participants were tested on their divergent thinking skills during a two-minute task, then spent five minutes on math problems, then were tested again on their divergent thinking. Half the participants were told that they’d be tested twice, while the other half were not informed.\n\nWhile both groups had higher scores after the math break—which allowed their brains to rest from the main task—those who had been told they’d be tested again benefitted more from the break than those who hadn’t. Researchers also found that participants who had scored better initially—suggesting a more creative mindset—benefitted even more from the break.\n\nAll of this suggests that consciously leaving tasks undone — leaving the last sentence of a paragraph unwritten, for example — will nudge your mind to continue cogitating without your conscious awareness. Such a strategy also evens out the highs and lows in creative work, provides a boost to creativity, and buffers against stress.\n\n> Consciously leaving tasks undone—leaving the last sentence of a paragraph unwritten, for example—will nudge your mind to continue cogitating without your conscious awareness.\n> \n\n## 5. Deep Sleeping\n\nSleeping is, of course, the ultimate form of rest and an important part of a creative and productive life.\n\nDuring the day, our bodies are mainly occupied with the business of living, spending energy on motor activity and cognitive functions. When we fall asleep, our bodies shift into maintenance mode and devote themselves to storing energy, fixing or replacing damaged cells, and growing, while our brains clean out toxins, process the day’s experiences, and sometimes work on problems that have been occupying our waking minds.\n\nMany researchers have found that [REM sleep is particularly important](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sara_Mednick2/publication/26275973_REM_not_incubation_improves_creativity_by_priming_associative_networks/links/02e7e529c297f514f4000000.pdf) for performance. For example, [in a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19005906) looking at anesthesiology interns and anesthetists, researchers found that after a couple of weeks of having night shifts or on-call duties, their work performance declined significantly. \n\nNot only that, but a sleep deficit of less than an hour per night led to declines greater than those seen in comparable groups tested in a sleep lab, suggesting that scientists may be underestimating the consequences of sleep loss in the real world.\n\nAll of the research points to the importance of rest in our fast-paced lives. While our culture may be pushing us toward working overtime, 24/7, this is clearly not helping us to be more productive or to come up with creative solutions to our problems.\nWhen we treat rest as work’s equal partner, recognize it as a playground for the creative mind and a springboard for new ideas, and learn ways to take rest more effectively, we elevate it into something valuable that can help calm our days, organize our lives, give us more time, and help us achieve more while working less.\nRest is not idleness. \n\nIt is the key to a better life.\n\n<br>\n<center> 🌟 __Join Shine's VIP community the [Shine Squad](http://www.shinetext.com/squad)__ 🌟 </center>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Rest","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/FOF8mDvoomO2QwguMQ0c4/c5876ed0742842aeac2cf6239bb83274/shutterstock_615019964.jpg","details":{"size":473547,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_615019964.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Alex Soojung-Kim Pang","bio":"<p>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is a Silicon Valley-based consultant and writer.

We dread it because, well, sometimes we don’t know the answer—or we’re too lazy or harried to come up with a good one. But we usually do our best, understanding that curiosity is key to learning.\n\nBut did you know that the benefits of curiosity are not limited to the intellectual? \n\nFor children and adults alike, curiosity has been linked with psychological, emotional, social, and even health benefits. Here are six of them!\n\n## 1. Curiosity helps us survive. \n\nThe urge to [explore and seek novelty](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/nine_things_educators_need_to_know_about_the_brain) helps us remain vigilant and gain knowledge about our constantly changing environment, which may be why our brains evolved to release dopamine and other feel-good chemicals when we encounter new things.\n\n\n## 2. Curious people are happier. \n\nResearch has [shown](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa8203_05#.Vbu4EWTF8m8) curiosity to be associated with higher levels of positive emotions, lower levels of anxiety, more satisfaction with life, and greater psychological well-being. Of course, it may be, at least partially, that people who are already happier tend to be more curious, but since novelty makes us feel good (see above), it seems likely that it goes the other direction as well.\n\n> Curiosity is linked with psychological, emotional, social, and even health benefits.\n \n\n---\n<center> *For more advice, [sign up](http://shinetext.com) for Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 3. Curiosity boosts achievement. \n\nStudies reveal that curiosity leads to [more enjoyment and participation in school](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/94/3/562/) and higher academic achievement, as well as greater learning, engagement, and performance at work. It may seem like common sense, but when we are more curious about and interested in what we are doing, it’s easier to get involved, put effort in, and do well.\n\n## 4. Curiosity can expand our empathy. \n\nWhen we are curious about others and talk to people outside our usual social circle, we become [better able to understand](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_empathic_people1) those with lives, experiences, and worldviews different than our own. Next time you have the chance to talk with a stranger, especially someone who may be quite dissimilar to you, try engaging with them on a personal level (respectfully, of course) and showing them that you are interested in what they have to say.\n\n\n## 5. Curiosity helps strengthen relationships. \n\n[One study](http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.23.6.792.54800) asked strangers to pose and answer personal questions, a process scientists call “reciprocal self-disclosure.” They found that people were rated as warmer and more attractive if they showed real curiosity in the exchange (while other variables like the person’s social anxiety and their levels of positive and negative emotions did not affect the partner’s feelings of attraction and closeness). This implies that demonstrating curiosity towards someone is a great way to build your closeness with them.\n\n\n## 6. Curiosity improves healthcare. \n\n[Research suggests](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/05/08_doctorpatient.shtml) that when doctors are genuinely curious about their patients’ perspectives, both doctors and patients report less anger and frustration and make better decisions, ultimately increasing the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n[READ NEXT: Be Bored, I Dare You](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/be-bored-i-dare-you/)\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-05-15T06:00"},"author":{"name":"Emily Campbell","bio":"<p>Emily Campbell is the research assistant for the Greater Good Science Center’s education program and a Ph.D. student in education at UC Berkeley.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"emily campbell","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/UUX6yJBzW026ms8Ge2Gaw/d874710f8e73f65775e812ba4725df69/emily_campbell.jpg","details":{"size":2459,"image":{"width":169,"height":182}},"fileName":"emily campbell.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Curiosity ","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/hqIjaKstWwiuuA6Cus2ym/c75f898456dfcfff227dc5a850471a85/shutterstock_351036215.jpg","details":{"size":146719,"image":{"width":500,"height":334}},"fileName":"shutterstock_351036215.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["novelty","fascination","curiosity","ask questions"]},"description":{"en-US":"Why we're better off when left with more questions than answers."},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"id":"3fyvsWWRwAcoAaOis2IcK2","urlPath":"articles/six-surprising-benefits-of-curiosity/"},{"title":{"en-US":"How to Give to Others Without Burning Out"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-give-to-others-without-burning-out"},"body":{"en-US":"*How to Give to Others Without Burning Out originally appeared in [Greater Good](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_give_to_others_without_burning_out). \n*\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>n our over-stressed world, many health care providers, social workers, and caregivers are suffering from slow yet [very real burnout](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/). Many of the rest of us, working long hours and raising families, seem to be approaching burnout, too. Sometimes we may feel that we’re too exhausted to keep giving to others, even though giving is a primary source of happiness in our lives.\n\nSo how can we keep giving without burning out? We’re told that self-care is the answer: Give yourself a treat; you deserve it. Take some time for yourself. Say no.\n\nIndeed, a research review found that psychologists in training who practice more self-care report feeling less distressed and stressed and more satisfied with life. The question is: What does self-care look like, and how much of it do we need? \n\nAs it turns out, the trick is to be other-focused and kind, but to balance that with taking care of yourself as well. Here are some practices to help you do that.\n\n## 1. Self Love\n\nOne particularly potent form of self-care involves transforming our relationship with ourselves—in particular, practicing self-compassion.\n\nSelf-compassion is treating yourself as you would a friend—with kindness rather than self-judgment—especially at times when you fail. Self-compassion is remembering that we all make mistakes, instead of beating ourselves up. And it means being mindful of emotions and thoughts without getting overly immersed in them. Self-compassion doesn’t mean being indulgent or letting yourself off the hook, but it also doesn’t mean being overly self-critical and harsh.\n\n> Self-compassion is treating yourself as you would a friend\n> \n\nElaine Beaumont at the University of Salford has conducted numerous studies looking at the impact of self-compassion on burnout and compassion fatigue. In [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26628352) of 100 student midwives—who routinely see both the miracle of new life and the tragedies that can accompany childbirth—Beaumont and her team found that midwives who had higher levels of self-compassion also showed less burnout and compassion fatigue symptoms. The opposite was true of midwives who were highly self-critical. She repeated this study with different caretaker professions and found similar results in nurses and students training to be counselors and psychotherapists.\n\nIn addition to being protected against burnout, people who are more self-compassionate tend to report feeling less stress and negative emotions. They’re also [more optimistic and feel more happiness](https://links9.mixmaxusercontent.com/tv494fWtn2mdCbthp/l/OCA15gBdlqqFTdKU2?messageId=ozmkoxafwaKc4pKg2&rn=gIoNnch1EIu92chpkI&re=gI1RWZukXZsV2ayVmYAh2cyFWbopmI) and other positive emotions, among other benefits.\n\n## 2. Social connection\n\nCaring for ourselves also means seeking social connections, who can provide practical and emotional support to us when we’re struggling. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503320) of nurses found that belonging to a more cohesive group at work helps prevent burnout and compassion fatigue, reducing the effects of stress and trauma.\n\nThis should come as no surprise: Social connection, from birth to old age, is one of our greatest human needs. [Social connection](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish/) leads to lower rates of anxiety and depression, strengthens our immune system, and can even [lengthen our life](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2001-07409-008).\n\n![JNAAU88O7N](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1ICTziNQX2E8K42G6EyS8K/2173ec98d20ac61197570e72b7fdc5d1/JNAAU88O7N.jpg)\n\nResearchers agree that social connection has less to do with [the number of friends](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-choose-who-to-spend-your-time-with/) you have than with how connected you feel on the inside, subjectively. In other words, you don’t have to be a social butterfly to reap the benefits; just aim to cultivate an internal sense of belonging with those around you.\n\nHow? \n\nThe tricky part is that stress is [linked to self-focus](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234073352_Manipulation_of_focus_of_attention_and_its_effects_on_anxiety_in_high-anxious_individuals_and_repressors); our stressed minds turn towards me, myself, and I—making us even more miserable and disconnected from others. Meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, and walks in nature, as well as curbing caffeine, can all help us calm down and feel ready to reach out to others. A study we conducted at Stanford showed that loving-kindness meditation can be a quick way to nurture a sense of connection. Better yet, try meditating with a partner!\n\n## 3. Empathy and compassion\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive that empathy—which includes attending to others’ struggles—would help us with our own, particularly for caregivers. But [research in social workers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173361) shows that having more empathy can also prevent burnout. Brain-imaging research by Tania Singer suggests that compassion training can actually make you better at coping with other people’s suffering—helping you help others without paying the cost yourself.\n\n> If we can figure out how to continue giving to others without suffering from burnout, we can expect to reap many benefits. \n> \n\nOne potential explanation for this finding is that, by developing feelings like compassion and empathy, we are protected from feeling distressed or overwhelmed in the face of suffering. When you truly connect with another person who is suffering, you can actually feel empowered and energized because you are inspired to uplift that person.\nWe’ve all had the experience of having a friend ask for help during a time of emergency. In these moments, we are usually capable of so much more than we imagined—we seem to find hidden reserves of energy. Afterward, we end up feeling much better than we did before.\n\nAgain, loving-kindness meditation is one way to start to cultivate empathy. When you speak with someone who is suffering, practicing active listening can help you provide comfort and support to them without having to solve their problems.\n\n## The benefits of giving\n\nIf we can figure out how to continue giving to others without suffering from burnout, we can expect to reap [many benefits.](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/altruism/definition#why_practice) \n\nFor example, [volunteering](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-you-can-make-an-impact-on-a-strangers-life/) can have a positive impact on health, with benefits for obesity, blood glucose, blood pressure, and longevity. Older volunteers can derive a great feeling of purpose and self-esteem from volunteering; research shows that it makes them feel happier, more connected to others, and more confident of their self-worth. The benefits of volunteering for well-being seem to be universal, holding across cultures as well as generations.\n\nOther studies have found that we’re happier when we spend money on others, and that we experience more positive emotions when we engage in acts of kindness for others, rather than ourselves.\n\nIf you are shy or introverted or even have social anxiety, giving to others can actually still increase your happiness. Although giving tends to feel better when we connect with beneficiaries, for the truly shy or those who don’t have time, even kind acts conducted over the computer can increase well-being.\n\nSelf-compassion, social connection, and empathy are powerful forms of self-care—but that doesn’t mean that traditional self-care activities have no place in our lives. Keeping your spirits up with exercise, sleeping in, and making room for fun activities like movies or shopping are important. These pleasures give us short bursts of happiness that can help fuel us and keep us playful in life. To complement these more physical pleasures, giving and connecting with others in positive ways will bring us long-lasting feelings of joy that come from a life of purpose and meaning. \n\nThe balance between the two is a ripe recipe for a happy, long, and fulfilling life.\n\n<br>\n<center> 🌟 __Join Shine's VIP community the [Shine Squad](http://www.shinetext.com/squad)__ 🌟 </center>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-05-12T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Emma Seppala","bio":"<p>Emma Seppälä, Ph.D., is the associate director of the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE) at Stanford University.

It holds so much promise, so much uncertainty, and way too much pressure. \n\n> Sometimes, we need to explore our skills in lots of different areas, trusting that someday they’ll weave together as they’re supposed to. \n\nWhen I was graduating college, I thought I needed [my career figured out](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-case-for-embracing-the-career-you-didnt-plan-to-have/) with a thirty-year plan. At 22, I was coordinating weddings on weekends to pay the rent while I worked at a startup nonprofit fighting slavery. I felt like my jobs were so… random. I had no idea that the event planning skills I learned on weekends would, in later years, allow me to plan global forums and galas and create experiences that engaged more people to support the nonprofit work I cared about. \n\n>  Vocation, Frederick Buechner said, is where your greatest passion meets the world’s greatest needs.\n\nSometimes, we need to explore our skills in lots of different areas, trusting that someday they’ll weave together as they’re supposed to. We need to realize that careers today are dynamic and multifaceted, not static and set. They are a process, not an end-point.\n\nVocation, Frederick Buechner said, is where your greatest passion meets the world’s greatest needs. So, where do you start? How do you begin that journey of finding your vocation? \n\n## Try new things \nA recent study by LinkedIn found that today’s college grad will change jobs four times in their first decade out of school. So take the pressure off! Take jobs where you can develop skills and have new experiences that will serve you in years to come. More and more professionals today are building portfolio careers—where you do a number of different things to generate income. The world is changing so quickly that your dream job in ten years probably doesn’t even exist today. Let go and lean into that learning process!\n\n## Do what you love \nWhat [makes your eyes light up](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/) and your pulse quicken? What makes you want to jump out of bed in the morning? It’s incredibly easy to spend our days doing ordinary things, and miss what we enjoy most. Whatever it is you love doing, don’t wait for someone else—let alone an employer—to give you permission to do it. You don’t need to be a writer to write, or a creative to create, or an analyst to do analytics! Find ways, big or small, here or there, to just start doing. As William Wordsworth said: “To begin, begin.”\n\n![network](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/19kTrOJticCiS6cKm2cOMC/2010593b0b1b871edd18b68983d9c885/network.jpeg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more life advice, [sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n## Find needs and meet them\nDon’t try to meet every need! But try meeting some needs. Maybe your coworker needs someone to talk to, and you can be a listening ear. Maybe your local shelter needs an extra set of hands each week, and you can be a support. Maybe you’re great at numbers, or social media, or organizing a room, and can help someone who can’t! Vocation is ultimately about meeting the needs of others in ways that you’re uniquely equipped. And that has nothing to do with whether you get paid for something.\n\n> Remember: The world is not waiting for you to get somewhere.\n \n## Think about where you’re unique\nThis can be your skills, your wisdom, your abilities, your knowledge, your interests. Every one of us is unique, which means we all have something diverse to offer. Whatever hard things you’ve gone through, whatever quirky skills or passions you have—those are the things that make you most equipped to serve, and to love, and to bring joy to other people. Begin by thinking about what makes you different from everybody else, and how that can help meet some of the needs around you.\n \n## Side hustle, honey!\nVocation doesn’t need to be something you make money doing. It can be the small projects, the volunteer work, or the hobbies you’re passionate about. Sometimes vocation is more about the way you work than it is about what you explicitly do. You can have a traditional job, but do it with insights, or creativity, or a flair all your own. The heart you bring to that job, and how you do it, is where your vocation lies. \n\nRemember: The world is not waiting for you to get somewhere. I always thought it was. I didn’t realize that the process of discovery—the questioning and the wandering and the uncertainty—is the journey of forming who I am. And that process of formation never stops, even when we find work we feel called to. Personally, I have no idea what my life and work will look like a year from now, and that’s not only okay—it’s exciting. \n\nYour vocation today may be different than your vocation tomorrow, so take the pressure off yourself and enjoy this wild ride! Your life’s journey is your life’s destination. And that very journey is where your vocation is found.\n\n[READ NEXT: The Case For Embracing the Career You Didn't Plan to Have](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-case-for-embracing-the-career-you-didnt-plan-to-have/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"To the Class of 2017: Your Career is a Process, Not an End-Point"},"slug":{"en-US":"to-the-class-of-2017-your-career-is-a-process-not-an-end-point"},"category":{"en-US":"life"},"tags":{"en-US":["college grad","vocation","passion","college graduation"]},"description":{"en-US":"Sometimes, we need to explore our skills in lots of different areas, trusting that someday they’ll weave together as they’re supposed to.

After spending years and years longing to be with the love of his life, Ryan Gosling overcomes his pride and lays out his heart, finally telling Rachel McAdams that “It” in fact, was not over.\n\n> “A person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.” — Tim Ferriss\n\n---\n\n<center>*For more advice, sign up for [Shine](http://www.shinetext.com)*</center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhen she hears this and realizes that her mother had been hiding his letters from her and that he did love her, she jumps into his arms (in the rain of course) and they live happily ever after.\n\nAlbeit cheesy, this story shows the impact a single conversation can have on your life.\nGosling’s character in the movie exhibits something very similar to how I used to handle tough conversations. Rather than speaking up, I would bottle up how I felt, hoping for a cinematic rain scene to finally express my true self, which of course never happened.\n\nHow many relationships are ruined because of this way of thinking? How many battles lost? How many lives wasted? All because someone was unwilling to have a tough conversation. In my opinion, too many.\n\n## Radical Acceptance\n\nPerhaps the biggest tragedy of our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns…We may want to love other people without holding back, to feel authentic, to breathe in the beauty around us, to dance and sing. \n\n> Yet each day we listen to inner voices that keep our life small.” –Tara Brach\n> \n\nI was the classic case of someone who avoided tough conversations. I hated confrontation. I wanted to please everyone. No, I needed to please everyone for validation that I was great and smart, and funny. However, this way of living left me empty. I was chasing a dream I did not want, surrounded by people [I did not want to be with](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-break-up-with-a-toxic-friend/). Why? Because it was what I was supposed to do.\n\n## Let’s be honest; you know what you need to do. \n\nYou have the words you need to say to correct a problem or mend a relationship, but due to past conditioning, you do not speak up.\n\nWhy? For me at least, it was because [I did not want to upset the status quo](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-gorgeous-reality-of-not-being-well-liked-by-everyone/). I figured if I kept my head down, bottled up my authentic voice, and follow the course, I would break free unscathed. But the tragedy of this mindset is that it leaves you living out life on the terms of others, rather than going after what really matters to you.\n\nTo me, this is the meaning of the maxim, “the richest place on earth is the graveyard.” In the graveyard, there are millions of people who had so much to offer but didn’t. Millions of people that had so much to say, but kept quiet. Millions of individuals who had so much beauty to share with the world that never did because they lacked the ability to speak their truth, and follow their unique path.\n\n![Nervous man](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3yNIjNhNqMegWG4e4Ug0Yy/7b685e89918dc6cb439627083711171b/shutterstock_225044401.jpg)\n\nTough conversations suck, especially the ones when you have to come to grips with a truth you have been avoiding and stand up to the ego that has been dragging you along.\n\nThe ego can destroy you. The ego has killed more dreams than failure ever has. It keeps you locked up in a prison of external validation. The ego will convince you that others are smarter. That their path is more secure. That what they say and believe should come before what you know inside to be true.\n\nHowever, if you ever want to make a dent in the world, you have to be able to master tough conversations. For me, that meant I first needed to confront the demons inside, because if I could not do that, no amount of external growth would matter. So, I began having those conversations. First in my head. Then on paper through journaling. Some were easy. Stop eating like shit. Some were hard. Take a break from your friends and lifestyle. One was monumental.\n\n__Accept that you have anxiety.\n__\nTara Brach, in her book Radical Acceptance, tells an anecdote about confronting your deepest fears and anxieties by inviting it to sit down for tea. I liked this notion, and I started inviting my anxiety to tea. I knew that to heal I had to accept my reality, and although the conversation was ongoing and took every ounce of energy I had, it started to change my relationship to my anxiety. What I once feared deeply, I now began to accept, even appreciate.\n\nThe more I accepted it, the more okay I became with the reality that anxiety, like all emotions, would always be there. Instead of waiting to be healed before I took risks, I started to step out on limbs daily, well knowing my friend would be there, and calmly inviting it for tea when it did. As I began to master my inner conversations and stopped shying away from conflict, my external life started to see changes as well.\n\n## The Loop\n\nI began to realize that the more tough conversations I had, the more confidence I gained in myself to make the right decision, which in turn made it easier to have the even more challenging talks later on. Psychologists call this the competence-confidence loop; the better you get at something, the more confidence you gain in your ability to perform the task. Conversations work the same way.\n\nThe more tough conversations you are willing to have, the more confident you will become in your ability to confront difficult, often uncomfortable, situations with growing ease.\n\nI began to see challenging conversations differently. I started to realize that my current status in life was the direct result of the decisions I had made in the past, and if I wanted something different in the future, all I needed to do was start making better decisions now, which meant having a lot of difficult conversations.\n\n## The Power of No\n\n> When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” — then say “no.” — Derek Sivers\n> \n\nThere is much debate in the self-help rotunda surrounding the idea of saying no to opportunities. I will give you my two cents. Say no. Say no to everything you are not excited about. I do not care if you are just starting out in your job or if you are a busy executive. Saying no is a secret superpower. Not only will it free you up to focus on what matters to YOU. Saying no is the best way to understand who you are and what you want. A life dictated by the schedule and desires of someone else is a failed one.\n\nWhen I decided to quit my first job in consulting, I had no plan. It was not preconceived. I had no other job waiting. What initiated the decision to leave was my newfound confidence in myself to have tough conversations. And my understanding of the power of no.\n\nI hated my job, and I knew it was not what I wanted to do, but unlike the me of the past, I did something about it. During my mid-year reviews, after receiving positive feedback, the Managing Director asked me what I thought about my future in the group. Without hesitation, I replied that I saw no future in the group, and in fact, I was quitting.\n\n__That was my last day working there.\n__\n\nI walked out of the office scared about what I would do next, but feeling a sense of clarity from just having another tough conversation, this time with someone else. My life was starting to take the direction I wanted it to go, and all because I was having conversations that I knew all along needed to take place.\n\nSure, I was afraid that I might not find a job or that I had just thrown my career away, but something happens inside of you the moment you start living your truth, it is an inner confidence that you will figure it out. And you know what, I did.\n\n### Take Action\n\nOne simple, but tough, method of practicing this is by committing yourself to talking to one stranger a day, beyond just *\"hello\"*. Ask the person what the most important lesson she learned from her father was. Ask him about his favorite meal to make. Ask them anything that goes deeper than the casual. The hardest part will be approaching them, but just tell yourself that you will never see this person again and who cares if you embarrass yourself. Plus, you will hear some amazing stories.\n\n## Be Steadfast in Your Decisions; Flexible in Your Approach\n\n<span class=dropcap>W</span>ithin days of leaving my previous job, I was on a plane to NYC for a final round interview with a startup, my dream job at the time. I nailed the interview and received the offer that night. I knew this meant that I would need to leave my girlfriend and friends to move to a new city where I only knew a few people, but something deep inside me said it was the right move.\n\nThe following week, my now fiancée and I discussed the offer in detail and what it meant for our relationship. Having this conversation was big for us. We had vaguely talked about our future in the past, and I think we both knew that we wanted to get married, but we had never gone deep on the notion of what to do if one of us moved.\n\n> Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. — Tony Robbins\n> \n\nWould she come? Would I deny it to stay close? These were all questions we had never discussed, so over dinner, we talked, and ultimately I told her that I would only take the job if she agreed to join me in NYC. A sentence I never thought I would ask her, but one she happily agreed to.\n\nFlash forward twelve months, we found ourselves again having a similar conversation about relocating. New York was not for us at that point in our life, and we wanted to transition somewhere else, and the only place we wanted to be was Chicago.\n\nWe had all the common fears. We had just moved from there, shouldn’t we give it a chance? Would we be able to find a job? Would people think we failed? Would we be able to sustain our new lifestyle?\n\nLike most fears, none of them came true. Yes, we had just moved to New York, but one day spent living a life not aligned with your purpose, is one day you will never get back, and we internalized that belief and knew we had to make a change. Gratefully, we had the ability to move, which I understand not everyone has.\n\n> “For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than one or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.” — Victor Frankl\n> \n\nWhat is important to note is that the decisions and the conversations you have are not the end all be all. Life is fluid. There will be things you cannot control, and things that you will change your mind about. If you are stubborn, unwilling to allow yourself to be pliable, you will find yourself living a life that was created out of pride. Be steadfast in the end goal, but flexible in the approach. We realized this and made a move and couldn’t be happier.\n\nNothing is harder than having an intimate, tough conversation with someone you love. The fear of hurting them is so intense that you often just forgo it. However, by doing this you cause far more pain than you save.\n\n### Take Action\n\nAnother method to grow your skill is something I learned from Noah Kagen. He calls it the coffee cup challenge. The premise is to walk into a random coffee shop, order your drink of choice, and when you come to the register ask the barista if you can have your drink for free. Do not give any explanation. Just ask and see what they say. It will be way harder than you think.\nFirewalk the Fear\n\n> “The greater danger for most of us in not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we hit it.” — Aristotle\n> \n\nBefore my fiancé moved to New York, a time came for another serious, and tough conversation. We needed to answer the all-important question, were we right for each other long-term?\n\nI knew that I was going to marry her, but I had never seriously thought about it. Moreover, if she was going to move away from her friends to be with me, I wanted to be crystal clear. In the past, we had had some serious, deep conversations, but rarely intentional ones about what we wanted in life, and more importantly what we did not. I think I feared these conversations because I did not want our relationship to change. I did not want to lose what we had, or even worse, what if we realized that we wanted completely different things in life?\n\nHowever, I knew that it would be better to discover our differences now than in twenty years. So, I got a pad of paper and wrote out every question/topic that I could think of to ask her.\n\nWe went out to dinner; I brought the notepad. She had no idea. We talked. We laughed. We discussed. However, we ended the meal more connected and secure in our relationship than ever before.\n\nI proposed a couple of months later.\n\nI honestly believe that if I had not had that conversation, our relationship would be half as good as it is now, but luckily we did, and the growth between us has been exponential. Failing to have conversations because you do not want to upset someone is a real fear, but one that is often unfounded, and even if it is the case that you upset them, wouldn’t you rather know that now?\n\nYou only get one life, don’t spend another minute with people who are not 100% for you and your purpose.\n\n### Take Action\n\nWhenever you go out to eat, try to ask if you can have an add-on or a side for free. Usually, they will just say no, and you will go on with your meal. However, the fear that swells up before asking is like fire walking an actual tough conversation and will condition your brain not to run away.\n\n## Keep It Small. Make it Stick.\n\n> “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a persistent one” — Albert Einstein\n> \n\nIf you cannot tell your waiter that he messed up your meal, you will never be able to tell your husband that you are completely distraught with your marriage. The ability to have tough conversations is a skill. Moreover, like all skills, it needs to be practiced before it can be mastered. You would not expect a novice athlete to compete at the Olympics, so why would you expect yourself to have the biggest conversations in your life if you have never practiced?\n\nStart small. Get the easy wins to build the confidence to move on to tougher conversations.\n\nThe opportunity to listen to the voice inside is constantly there, but a lifelong conditioning to follow the norm can crowd it out. So, to amplify this voice, you need to practice it daily. Cultivate opportunities to speak your truth using the methods above.\n\nStop waiting for the rainy day to release the tension, and express what is wrong. You get no dress rehearsals. Your life is the main stage. You only have one chance to live. You have the power. No one is going to do it for you, so get out there and start giving yourself permission to live well.\n\n\n[READ NEXT: 3 Ways to Slay Your Fear (And Why We Worry)](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"title":{"en-US":"The Freedom of Asking for What You Need"},"slug":{"en-US":"the-freedom-of-saying-what-you-need"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-05-09T08:30"},"author":{"name":"Benjamin Foley","bio":"<p>A fierce believer in all humans!

Do you often answer the question: “How are you?” with “soooo busy” or “things are crazy busy at the moment!”\n \nWe’ve all heard the saying, “If you want something done, ask a busy person.” And there is truth to that. However, there’s a difference between working with purpose and intent vs. squeezing as much in as possible. \n\n> Your work is your own and you define your own success.\n\nBusy makes people feel important. It feels good to be busy and there’s a connection to feeling accomplished or successful and wanting to share that with others. Everyone wants to be heard and appreciated. But “Busy-itis” can come from wanting the approval of others and it’s exhausting trying to keep up which can prevent you from doing work you love and being your most efficient and productive self. \n\nIt's less about actually being busy with a full calendar and more about how a person wants to be perceived. “Busy-itis” can also come from not being comfortable or wanting to sit with yourself alone. Making the time to slow down can actually take a lot of work. Sounds easy to “sit down” but quieting the mind and looking inward to discover that [true confidence comes from within and you don’t need the approval of others](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-stop-crowdsourcing-your-confidence/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). Your work is your own and you define your own success.\n \n> Getting over “busy-itis” can be a process but well worth it – there is a chance for you to enjoy every single day to the fullest AND feel proud of your work.\n\n---\n\n<center> [Sign up](http://shinetext.com) for free, daily advice from Shine. </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n \nYou manifest change and the opportunity for you to enjoy every single day instead of running around like crazy, trying to check everything off your to-do list, see your friends and family and make time for yourself - this doesn't mean taking a workout class to check another thing off your list but truly making time for self care and rest. There will be a moment when you realize that you’re spread too thin and that you chose this busy lifestyle. I’ve been there – you are just completely exhausted and left feeling drained. I wanted to keep pushing myself and kept coming up with the question, when will it ever be enough?\n\nA very common symptom of \"busy-itis\" is brain fog. Brain fog can be as simple a forgetfulness, confusion or lack of mental clarity. Sometimes we move so fast throughout the day, we are on auto pilot and don't remember how we got from point A to point B. High levels of stress hormones can cause brain fog - feelings of stress, anxiety, anger, fear and frustration. When your mind is fuzzy, you can't retain knowledge as well. \n\nAnother common symptom is exhaustion. This is not the same as feeling tired but total depletion which can be caused by stress. Often times we manage our stress with keeping busy and distracting ourselves or trying to completely ignore what is actually going on. If you are frequently getting sick, this is another sign of stress overload or \"busy-itis.\" Do you feel like you are coming down with a cold more often than your friends? Those who suffer from \"busy-itis\" especially need to listen to their bodies and not power through the day when they are feeling under the weather. If you don't break the cycle, \"busy-itis\" can snowball into a long term health condition such as depression or heart disease. Just remember that the mind and body are intrinsically connected.\n\n> When we learn to slow down, we begin to truly connect with our work and with others.\n\nGetting over “busy-itis” can be a process but well worth it – there is a chance for you to enjoy every single day to the fullest AND feel proud of your work.\n \n## 3 Tips for Those Suffering From “Busy-itis”\n<p> __1. Create a morning routine:__ [Enjoy your morning](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/7-ways-to-start-your-morning-off-right/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) and wake a little earlier to make some extra time for yourself. This can mean journaling, reading or cooking breakfast. Having a morning breath work or meditation practice can be extremely beneficial and will prepare to take on the day!\n<br>\n<br>\n__2. Redefine your to-do list: __ Instead of creating a long list, make your to-do list more of an exercise and ask yourself why next to each item. This will help you set your intentions for the day and remind yourself to acknowledge the tasks that you love doing.\n<br>\n<br>\n__3. Remove the word busy from your vocabulary!__ Come up with another response for when people ask, “how are you doing”. Stop telling people how busy you are. Take a moment to confidently share the work you are doing which will have you build stronger relationships and have deeper connections in the long run!</p>\n\nAfter many years of “busy-itis” it may be tough to change your thought patterns and automatic responses. But, it is totally doable with these 3 simple steps. [When we learn to slow down](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-surprising-antidote-to-busyness/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), we begin to truly connect with our work and with others.\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Back Your Me-Time](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"author":{"name":"Erica Joy Dunn","bio":"<p>Erica Joy Dunn is a Reiki Master and Certified Holistic Health Coach, working with people who are looking to improve and restore their vital health through spirituality.

However, it is as, in your head, you have a broken record that continues replaying the same thoughts over and over again with no end.\n\nWhen you consciously focus on the breath you are not just cultivating mindfulness; you are also creating stillness in your mind. Giving it a much-needed break from the constant barrage of thoughts that plague most of your day.\n\n> “Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.” ― Pema Chödrön\n> \n\nFor the average person, we spend most of our days projecting into the future or reminiscing about the past. In both cases, we are absent in the present. Therefore, absent from life.\n\nWe think about why Sheryl in accounting hasn’t emailed us back or how many carbs that sandwich we ate at lunch today had or worrying about if our career is on the right path.\n\nIf these thoughts were just a record, you could press stop. But life is not so simple. We cannot just stop our thoughts. No matter how badly we want to or how hard we try.\n\nThis is why it's important for us to practice, __'the art of being awake.'__\n\nYou see, for most things, there is a science to achieving them. Follow this guide and work hard and you will get to where you want to be. However, there is no science for learning how to live a fulfilled life. No one set of instructions everyone can follow to achieve mastery of living.\n\nYour life is a blank canvas. YOU are the painter. Mindfulness is the art.\n\n## The art of living.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-10-18 at 8.41.35 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6wa7tYPZeMsAyyyaUYoMoS/d35536f4f0fe02355e34654b58ab50a6/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.41.35_AM.png)\n\nMindfulness is not mediation. It is an operating system for your life. It is the underlying framework upon which you can paint the masterpiece of your life. It is a dance that requires the skill to maintain awareness of our minds as they jump from one thing to another, seeking distraction or avoiding difficulty.\n\n*So how do we learn this art form?\n*\n## The answer, I’ve found, is finding stillness.\n\nOur mental processes — jumping around and distraction and being caught up in stories — only cause us stress when we latch onto them and [tell ourselves a story about why they arise](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-things-to-do-when-you-feel-like-life-is-getting-out-of-control/). These thoughts are not only common; I think they are part of the normal human condition. But if this is how our minds are most of the time, then being afflicted by this condition is probably going to cause us constant anxiety.\n\n*Instead, I find it more helpful to learn to:\n*\n<p>•  Be aware of these mental conditions; </p>\n\n<p>•  Be present with the mental pattern and stay with it; and </p>\n\n<p>•  Work with the situation in a mindful way. </p>\n\n<p>•  The only way to master this is by finding stillness in your day. </p>\n\n> Mindfulness is not mediation. It is an operating system for your life.\n> \n\n### We are starting to get a little more serious now. Are you up for it?\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">F</span>*ind Stillness: Take one 8 minute break out of your busy day and try to do the following:*\n\n<p>• __Sit still__ and look away from all devices and other activities. Just sit there, maybe with your eyes closes, perhaps looking at nature or a wall. </p>\n\n<p>• __Take a moment __to assess your condition. How do you feel? Are you tired, anxious, frustrated, calm, happy? What state is your mind in? </p>\n\n<p>• __Assess how you’ve been behaving recently __(today, or just in the last hour) … have you been constantly distracted? In a state of busyness? Focused? Procrastinating? Anxious or fearful? Irritated? Feeling down? </p>\n\n<p>• __Stay with these feelings__ for a moment, just being curious and non-judgmental about them. </p>\n\n<p>• __ Feel each of them__, and notice the mental pattern that caused it. If you’re frustrated, are you stuck in a resentful story about someone else or your current situation? If you’re anxious, is there some desired outcome that you’re holding tightly to? If you’re feeling down, are you comparing your situation with some ideal that you don’t have? </p>\n\n<p>• __Bring your attention to your body__. How does it feel? What sensations can you notice in your head, neck, arms, hands, torso, hips, butt, legs, feet? </p>\n\n<p>• __Can you find gratitude__ at this moment? Can you find love or compassion, for yourself or others? </p>\n\nYou don’t have to do all of these things each time you [find stillness](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-surprising-antidote-to-busyness/), but these are all things you can help you become more aware of what your mind and body are trying to tell you.\n\n## Tips for when/how to make this happen:\n\n__Do it in the shower: __The average person takes an 8-minute shower every single day. This could be an excellent time to create space for stillness in an activity you already do. Try not to try to remain present the whole time.\n\n__Do it first thing when you wake up or right before you go to bed:__ The first thing I do [every single morning](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/7-ways-to-start-your-morning-off-right/) right after I wake up exercises my mind (i.e., meditation). Not because it offers more value in the morning, but because the morning is the one time of day that I completely control.\n\n__Do it on your commute:__ You may be reading this on your commute right now. Stop and set a timer for 8-minutes and just sit. You do not have to close your eyes or chant. Just stop whatever you are engaged with and find stillness.\n\nI can give you all the tips in the world, but ultimately it is up to you to take the time to find stillness in your life. It will benefit your life in more ways than you can imagine!\n\n\n[READ NEXT: Two Steps To Help You Find Your Meaning and Purpose](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/two-steps-to-help-you-find-your-meaning-and-purpose/)\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Meditate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/dlycApKAPQSIKWWGi6EQA/d4caeaac1eab74467ff6f1cc8b80bf03/shutterstock_492455716.jpg","details":{"size":531150,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_492455716.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Benjamin Foley","bio":"<p>A fierce believer in all humans!

Excited and scared. While mixed emotions are familiar to many of us, they’re still a bit of a mystery to psychologists.\n\nInitially, many researchers believed—and some still do—that it isn’t possible to feel both positive and negative at the same time. But more and [more research](http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/pdf/larsen.mcgraw.cacioppo.2001.pdf) is suggesting that mixed emotions do exist—more often [as we get older](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/hal.hershfield/resources/Research/2012-Hershfield.pdf), and [among women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397957/). But why would this kind of emotional experience be useful to us?\n\n[A new paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313035253_When_Feeling_Mixed_Can_Be_Meaningful_The_Relation_Between_Mixed_Emotions_and_Eudaimonic_Well-Being) has taken some early steps to explore how mixed emotions contribute to our well-being, and it suggests that they may play a role in the search for meaning in life.\n\n## How happy-sad are you?\n\nThe paper covers two studies. In the first, researchers recruited 52 college seniors who were about to graduate. The seniors reported on the positive and negative emotions they were feeling at the moment, allowing the researchers to calculate a score for mixed emotions. Then the participants watched a short video about graduation designed to induce bittersweet feelings. To the tune of fast-paced but sad music, it said things like “You’ll miss the university and the friends you’ve made…but you’re also looking forward to the future and the exciting possibilities it holds”:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ymyZkeHmcg4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more advice, [sign up](http://shinetext.com) for Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nAfter watching the video, participants again reported how they were feeling. They also completed a questionnaire measuring their sense of purpose or meaning. If they scored high, that meant they believe they know what they’re meant to do in life.\nOverall, the video did appear to elicit mixed emotions: Afterward, participants felt more happy-sad and enthusiastic-sad than beforehand. And the more their mixed feeling of enthusiasm-sadness increased, the greater their sense of purpose and meaning in life.\n\n“Mixed emotions seem to be a relevant companion in the creation of a meaningful life,” says lead author Raul Berrios, an associate professor at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile.\n\n## How mixed emotions make meaning\n\nMixed emotions may be related to meaning, then, but how?\n\nA second study Berrios and his colleagues conducted shed some light on this question. Here, over 400 students filled out surveys measuring their sense of meaning or purpose in life and if they’d recently experienced an event that provoked mixed emotions. The survey also asked if, and how much, their life goals had recently come into conflict.\nThe analysis suggested that these factors were all related: Participants with more conflicting goals tended to have stronger mixed emotions. The stronger their mixed emotions, the more actively they were searching for meaning in life, and (in turn) the more meaning and purpose they felt.\n\n> Mixed emotions seem to be a relevant companion in the creation of a meaningful life.\n> \n\nHow can we interpret these results? Berrios seems to envision mixed emotions as a kind of red flag for conflicting goals, a signal of some discrepancy we need to resolve in order to make meaning out of our lives. In the case of the college seniors, for example, they might simultaneously want to preserve their current friendships and connect with new people outside school, or savor their last months of college but also prepare for finding a job. Being aware of these conflicts could motivate them to form a plan and [craft a narrative](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_will_the_theme_of_your_life_be_this_year) about how to transition from one life stage to another.\n\n“Situations involving common personal dilemmas tend to [be linked to] the experience of mixed emotions,” says Berrios. “This may be important to understand how people construe a meaningful life in the face of difficulties.”\n\nIn moments of conflict or stress—when feeling purely good may not be possible for us—mixed emotions could thus be a healthy pattern. Past research suggests that mixed emotions can help us [be more resilient](https://anthonyongphd.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ong-bergeman-2004a.pdf) and [cope with adversity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265843103_Turning_adversity_to_advantage_on_the_virtues_of_the_coactivation_of_positive_and_negative_emotions), like [when bereaved spouses still experience moments of humor.](http://personal.kent.edu/~kcoifman/publications_files/2007_Coifman_Bonanno_Rafaeli.pdf)\n\nBerrios emphasizes that these studies are preliminary, and he says we can’t assume, without further research, that mixed emotions cause us to search for meaning. And not all mixed emotions may be created equal: The disappointment-relief I feel after dropping an ice cream cone that would have blown my diet may not motivate any major soul-searching.\n\nStill, this study suggests (yet again) that [we don’t have to feel good all the time](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/five_ways_feeling_good_can_be_bad_for_you) in order to live a fulfilling life—and that some bad feelings may actually be part of the process.\n\n[READ NEXT: Two Steps To Help You Find Your Meaning and Purpose](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/two-steps-to-help-you-find-your-meaning-and-purpose/)\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Mixed emotions","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/G7NFnxwsk60eIgO2yGGgA/0487a7e2025b6f7ecc11464b1c7c5894/shutterstock_210901393.jpg","details":{"size":562627,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_210901393.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-05-02T00:00"},"author":{"name":"Kira M.

The more sentimental and nostalgic, the better.  But it must be true. I envy those who get along with fiction better than I do.  It's like a food you want to like but can't. Every so often I try, and beat myself up for putting it down (and away) before the second chapter.  Because I read everything with a highlighter in hand, it's hard for me to get down with a story that doesn't require notation.  I know...it's like a disease.  I choose to celebrate it.\n\nTrue storytelling is part of me, and it's no surprise that it became my life's work.  Anyone reading my writing can see that my work self and life self are not separate.  I live the way I work, and vice versa.  In my tenure of learning the qualitative research business, that was not always the case. I've helped the world's largest companies understand their customers, positioning their global products to launch with a one-two punch. Sometimes I observe the way people interact with products and services like emerging technologies; other times I explore theoretical underpinnings for why humans think, feel and act the way we do.\n\n![journalheader](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/rpsqcqGRbMGumGwcquqii/225e333e9612acb93591fa5c1cfa0ab4/journalheader.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more advice, [sign up](http://shinetext.com) for Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\nThe stories I tell range from why a southern priest would be among the first adopters of the iPad, using it in his traveling sermons, to riding through the English countryside in a mobile veterinary trailer to attend the birth of a foal, where my goal was to observe the delivery systems of the many pharmaceuticals involved.  This is consumer insights work at its most exciting. Yet through all of this exhilaration, a question was following me around:\n\n## What is the meaning and purpose of what you do? \n\nEasy answer - I'm helping to improve lives through technological and healthcare advancements. But couldn't I go deeper?  Other experiences culminated in my life at this same point in time (enter cancer and a few other big ones), and I found myself at a crossroads.  For me, indecision means voracious reading!  For anyone at a similar juncture, I recommend the following appetizers of amazingness:\n\n<p>  • The Firestarter Sessions, Danielle LaPorte </p>\n<p>  • A Hidden Wholeness, Parker J. Palmer </p>\n<p>  • Daring Greatly, Brene Brown </p>\n\nAfter the brain re-orientation of the Firestarter Sessions - a how to find your work/passion guide - it became clear that the crossroads wasn't about work.  My question shifted:\n\n> I came to the conclusion that I, together with every person on earth, am here to infuse meaning and purpose.  \n\n## \"What is the meaning and purpose of who I am?\"\n\nNow I'm going all existential on you.  There is a time in everyone's life when they enter a flurry of philosophical inquiry and self-reflection.  Let it in!  The tone of the question began to change from nudging to urgent. From nagging to inspiring. I came to the conclusion that I, together with every person on earth, am here to infuse meaning and purpose.  Sort of a tautological answer, but here's what I mean.  Evolving as a person meant first valuing myself, and then elevating others to identify their own value. Humankind needs to hold hands in the cultivation process.  Now, I'm no crunchy meditative guru (as much as I covet that kind of work...I must not be ready yet).  I'd made that realization, and my practical side chimed in promptly and said, \"K, but what are you going to DO about this?\"  The key to a paradigm shift is proliferation, and the belief that change can and does start with an N of 1.  \n\n## My first step was to recognize that sense of purpose must cut across one's personal and professional life.  \n\nA way of Being in one area of life cannot be mutually exclusive from a way of Being in another. In Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth, he calls this the flowering of human consciousness.  If we stop to observe, we can see and feel how we are beginning to take care of each other as a global community.  Btw, this book is a work/life bible.  I didn't mention it above because it's in it's own league. The other book to live by is Adam Grant's [Give and Take:  Why Helping Others Drives Our Success](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986). The basic premise is that the givers of the world produce win-win situations, and along the way create opportunities for a chain reaction of good will.  When we give our time, talent and knowledge to another without expectation of a return, the return comes barreling toward us 100-fold on both the happiness and monetary front. This is not a book about karma or faith.  Case studies with hard evidence show us why success must be redefined to [put giving front and center](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-you-can-make-an-impact-on-a-strangers-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog).  The deep ripple effect is proven, and it matches Tolle's flowering notion.\n\n> I relaxed my frantic search for work that paid the bills, and began presenting myself differently - my genuine self only, always.\n\n## My second step was to make a vow: I will do work that passes my meaning and purpose gut check, and elevates humankind. \n\nThe vow brought an immediate change to what I was 'putting out there.' I relaxed my frantic search for work that paid the bills, and began presenting myself differently - my genuine self only, always.  This brought in people, ideas, collaborations and innovation from a wide net of [like-minded people and organizations](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-secret-to-only-doing-things-you-actually-want-to-do/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog).  Before my eyes, the work/life boundaries began to MELD.  This kind of shift requires a suspension of immediate gratification - you may not get the job, relationship, or money right away.  But when you do, you know they are right kind.  I don't yet know what steps 3 and beyond will ask of me, but I'll be ready.  I know this works, and it can work for anyone willing to break the mold.  When you live congruously, everything else falls into place. \n\n[READ NEXT: 3 Things You Should Know About Intersectionality and Self-Care](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-things-you-should-know-about-intersectionality-and-self-care/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Julie Krohner","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://juliekrohner.com\">Julie Krohner</a> is a social scientist, speaker and writer with a passion for an egoless world full of empathy.

How often does your mood and confidence depend on the number of likes you get on Facebook, Twitter, or any other place that has social currency?\nSadly, many of us trade social currency for confidence. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right? I’ll like your dog pictures on Facebook. And you like my cool new profile picture with sunglasses while I’m looking away from the camera.\n\nThere’s one downside this exchange. It’s fleeting - and makes us more reliant on external validation than ourselves.\n\nIt’s what I call crowdsourcing confidence. But, what happens when no one likes the stuff we share? We feel like crap.\n\n## Why is that?\nIt’s not only on [social media](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-social-media-can-boost-your-confidence/). A lot of people don’t have social media profiles at all. Instead, they trade compliments from their spouse, boss, friends, colleagues, for confidence.\n\nYou see, everybody does it. That’s why we feel better when someone tells us, “good job.”\n\nIt’s validation. We depend on it. For years, I’ve chased validation without even knowing it. It just creeps in your system.\n\n![df](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3m42Z1lrhK0AaQcwMakOu0/4998af96099abab5c90c635a3b7de9d4/df.jpeg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more tips to help boost your confidence, sign up for [Shine.](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, I worked hard to get validation from clients or prospects. If people didn’t like our products, I doubted myself. But when a client gave me a compliment the next day, I thought I was doing well.\n\nAnd when I worked for a major corporation, it was the same. When my colleagues or boss acknowledged my work, I was happy with my job. And when people didn’t acknowledge my effort, it was the worst job in the world.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\n## It’s also true for relationships.\n“He didn’t even notice my new haircut.”\n\n“She never mentions anything about my progress in the gym.”\n\n“I was always there to support him. Now he doesn’t call me anymore.”\n\nThat type of behavior damages relationships, and more importantly: Yourself.\n\n## “But why should I do anything? \n\nDo things for yourself. Not in a selfish way. You’re here for a limited time so you might as well enjoy it. And stop worrying about what other people think about you.\n\nDon’t rely on outside sources like compliments or attention.\n\n> “Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.” — Norman Vincent Peale\n> \n\n## “How do I become confident if I can’t crowdsource it?”\n\nHave you heard of Mirror Neurons? In the 80s, neuroscientists in Italy found that primates have neurons in their brain that are responsible for imitative behavior. In simple words: We copy each other’s behavior. That’s how I also learned to stop searching for validation. From my mentors.\n\n[Confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/) starts with a belief. It’s something you can create instantly within yourself. Instead of believing that you can’t you start believing that you can. \n\nNext, your body follows. Instead of sitting hunched, with your shoulders pointing towards the ground, you straighten up, open up your chest, and breathe through your nose.\nThink it. Feel it. Do it. Believe it. \nI have several mentors, and they all work hard for themselves. But at the same time, they also provide value for other people.\n\nBecause they don’t worry about what other people think of them, they can spend their time on their own business.\n\n> “I work hard for the audience. It’s entertainment. I don’t need validation.” — Denzel Washington\n> \n\nAnd the best thing about stopping to crowdsource your confidence is that you can focus on what matters. At the end of the day, you’re not defined by how many likes, compliments, or pats on the back you receive.\n\nYou are your actions. As Aristotle put it:\n\n> “We are what we repeatedly do.”\n> \n\nActions are the only tangible thing we have in this world. It’s not our word that counts. And if you feel strength in your own abilities, you will ultimately become more confident.\n\nYou have more capabilities than you think. You just have to look inside yourself, not outside.\n\n[READ NEXT: The Big Lie Killing Your Confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"How to Stop Crowdsourcing Your Confidence"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-stop-crowdsourcing-your-confidence"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Confidence ","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6Ie5sL0XMQmEkWcM6eaKMi/8b0618d0d05924996f86ef2218cf15e3/shutterstock_42970828.jpg","details":{"size":715042,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_42970828.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-25T07:30"},"author":{"name":"Darius Foroux","bio":"<p>An entrepreneur, author, and podcaster.

Yet it is a vital emotion that helps you cultivate creativity, contemplation, and stillness. It is essential for the mind to be bored.\n\nA couple of weeks back [I deleted several apps](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life/) from my phone: Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, Facebook, among others, in an attempt to force myself to be bored. I’m trying to let go of the things that I would usually use to ‘fill the space.’ I want to learn to be okay with just being.\n\n> We are less bored than our ancestors were, but we are more afraid of boredom. We have come to know, or rather to believe, that boredom is not part of the natural lot of man, but can be avoided by a sufficiently vigorous pursuit of excitement. — Bertrand Russell\n\n__Here is the list of things I let go of to find more boredom in the everyday:__\n\n<p>• All Social Media \n<p>• Favorite blogs & websites\n<p>• All News websites\n<p>• YouTube (or other video sites, unless needed)\n<p>• Shopping, buying crap\n<p>• Reading more than one book at a time! Huge for me!\n<p>• Checking email on my phone\n<p>• Doing anything while eating\n<p>• Alcohol on weekdays\n<p>• Needing to do something all the time\n\n## Why?\n\nBecause distractions are a crutch, a mental habit, a refuge for the mind. They help us hide from difficult emotions, the present moment, and the [fear of not being busy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-surprising-antidote-to-busyness/).\n\nYou might be thinking, “What’s wrong with a little distraction, a little mental break?”\n\nI don’t believe there is anything wrong with letting your mind rest, but I believe we should be more aware of our constant need to take ourselves out of the present moment.

In each other, we found an accessible, peer-based approach to our daily wellbeing.\n\nShocked that nothing like this existed at scale, we asked our friends where they turned when they needed reinforcements. From celebrating a high, like a new promotion, to processing a low like a breakup, we wanted to know where our friends went for daily support and tactical advice on how to work on themselves with self-compassion.

Would you ever choose busyness over a more relaxed form of productivity? When life starts to feel hectic, here are a few ways to dial back the overwhelm.\n\n## 1. Give yourself a shot of awe\n\nWhen [researchers induced feelings of awe](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/10/1130.short) in people—by showing them video clips of people next to vast things like whales or waterfalls—it altered their perception of time such that the people felt like they had more time on their hands. So much time on their hands, in fact, that awestruck people become likely to give away their time by volunteering to help someone out. \n\nThey also report fewer feelings of impatience.\n\n> Busyness is a mark of what neuroscientists call “cognitive overload.”\n> \n\nNot sure where to find yourself some awe? Look no farther than YouTube. Try searching “awe” and “whales,” or just watch this [oldie but goodie video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA3A5RQB1Lk)—it makes me feel awestruck every time. If the concept of “awe” feels too abstract, try thinking about things that amaze you. What makes you feel a childlike sense of wonder? Makes you feel elevated or inspired? Now take five minutes to let one of those things work their magic on your busy brain.\n\n## 2. Create an anti-busyness ritual\n\n[Researchers believe](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763410001314) that the brains in both humans and animals evolved to feel calmed by repetitive behavior, and that our daily rituals are a primary way to manage stress. This is especially true in unpredictable environments or situations where we feel pressured, a lack of control, or threatened in some way.\n\nWhen the pace of life seems to be taking off without you, create a ritual to help you feel more in control. What counts as a ritual? Something you do repetitively in certain situations—usually a series of behaviors done in the same order. Think of your favorite ball player’s pregame ritual.\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for more life advice.* </center>\n\n---\n\nWhen I start to feel pressured for time, my own “busyness ritual” kicks in: I stretch my neck (first by looking to the left, and then to the right, and then by tipping my left ear to my left shoulder and my right ear to my right shoulder). I exhale deeply with each stretch, and then center my head, and straighten my posture. \n\n> When the pace of life seems to be taking off without you, create a ritual to help you feel more in control.\n> \n\nOn my last exhale, I think to myself: “I have plenty of time.” The stretching and deep breathing may be what helps me feel calm, but also [having and using a ritual](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110922093324.htm)—any ritual—can help us feel more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\n## 3. Find “flow”\n\nDropping into “the zone” or finding flow is the opposite of feeling busy. Time seems to stand still—if we are aware of time at all. Flow isn’t as elusive a state as you might think, but it does require that we stop multi-tasking, and that we build a fortress against interruption around ourselves. (I also have a “get into the flow” ritual that I use before I write).\n\nI know, I know. You don’t have time to foster awe, or create an anti-busyness ritual, or stop multi-tasking. You’re too busy!\n\nListen: You don’t have time NOT to do these things. Busyness is a mark of what neuroscientists call “cognitive overload.” This state impairs our ability to think creatively, to plan, organize, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, resist temptations, learn new things easily, speak fluently, remember important social information, and control our emotions. In other words, it impairs basically everything we need to do in a given day. So if you have important work to do, please: Take five minutes to dial back your busyness.\n\n<center>__[Join our VIP community the Shine Squad](http://www.shinetext.com/squad?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)__</center>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"The Surprising Antidote to Busyness"},"slug":{"en-US":"the-surprising-antidote-to-busyness"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"shutterstock 553195012","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5bSGVjfTWEiagAqYwsc2AM/dc6c32ca5d4cca4b5ef616704cee8b23/shutterstock_553195012.jpg","details":{"size":710612,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_553195012.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-16T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Christine Carter","bio":"<p>Christine Carter, Ph.D. is a Senior Fellow at the Greater Good Science Center.

Whether you’ve got too many assignments for your classes, too much work at your internship, or too much drama with your friends, there are plenty of things out there that’ll stress you out.\n\nThe good news, though, is you don’t have to feel like you have no say in any of it. Here are five of my favorite strategies for getting back in control when you feel like your life is spinning in every direction.\n\n## 1. Clean\n\nI’m sure that your room is probably a mess if you feel out of control! My advice? Open the windows and start cleaning! Do your laundry, change your bedding, and take your rugs outside and shake them off. Sweep and mop. If your living space allows it, light a candle!Just get it all [clean.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\nNow look around; isn’t it pretty? Breathe in deep and enjoy a tidy space.\n\n## 2. Exercise\n\nGet out and exercise, because nobody can keep you from doing that for your body. Plus, it will relieve some stress. As a student, typically there is a recreation center available to you for no charge. And if not, get outside, and [run around your area or on a trail](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog).\n\nEven if you feel like going out isn’t for you, there are plenty of exercises you can do from the comfort of your own home. Here are some great options I like to refer to:\n\n<p>• [Hip Hop Fat Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI-z1bHEk-c) // CARDIO BEAT (At Home No Jumping Cardio) by Blogilates </p>\n<p>• [Best Home Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI-z1bHEk-c) / 10 Mins / No Gym Equipment by Live Lean TV</p>\n<p>• [12 Minute Indoor Cardio Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ4n2bzGCJ8) by Live Lean TV </p>\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for more life advice.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Start With Small Goals\n\nMaking a small goal for yourself can make you feel like you achieved something and therefore feel more in control. Just make sure it is something you can achieve on your own, otherwise, someone else is controlling your success.\n\nStumped on how to start? Here are a few suggestions:\n\n<p> 1. Work out everyday for a week.</p>\n<p> 2. Don’t drink any soda for a certain number of days. </p>\n<p> 3. Drink eight glasses of water per day for a week straight. </p>\n<p> 4. Journal every day for a week. </p>\n<p> 5. Make your bed every morning for a week. </p>\n<p> 6. Learn five new vocabulary words per week for the next month. </p>\n\nAlso, don’t be afraid to tell friends and family about what you’re trying to achieve. Accountability is everything.\n<br>\n\n![journalheader](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/rpsqcqGRbMGumGwcquqii/225e333e9612acb93591fa5c1cfa0ab4/journalheader.jpg)\n## 4. Plan\n\nPull out your planner, and if you don’t have one, it’s time to buy one, go check out this post for some suggestions.\n\nI find that sitting down and planning out my week or month really helps me to get a handle on things and get rid of that chaotic, out-of-control feeling. There are a lot of different ways to plan, and I would highly recommend you experiment with them and figure out what works best for you!\n\nHere are some good planning resources:\n\nIf you want to try a bullet [journal](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog):\n<p>• [Boho Berry’s Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTjjS_Cqrde9bR9Gz4PqdA) </p>\n<p>• [How I Set Up My Bullet Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS58hEKNZtc) by Haley Cairo</p>\n<p>• [Bullet Journal Set Up Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o1n1D37W8s) by Haley Cairo</p>\n\nWeekly planners to try:\n<p>• [My Planning Sessions: How I Use My Planners (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCLAk0dZUiE) by Pretty Neat Living</p>\n<p>• [How I Plan, Organize, & Decorate My Erin Condren Planner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtICTxUZ0eo) by Polina Beregova(</p>\n<p>• [How I Plan: Weekly Planning Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4RTlvfbJw) by Mary Heather Browne</p>\n<p>• [Plum Paper Planner Review](http://sarastrives.com/plum-paper-planner/) by Sara Fry</p>\n\n## 5. Create Your Own Momentum\n\nIf you know why you [feel out of control](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), see if there are small actions you can take to change course.\n\nMaybe it’s a group project and someone is bossing you around on your part. Stand your ground and politely tell him or her, “Hey, this is my part of the assignment, let me give it a shot. And if it doesn’t work or doesn’t fit the guidelines, I will fix it.”\n\nMaybe your friend is controlling your social life; let her know that you need to be allowed to have other friends or even stop talking to her for a short period of time. You don’t have to vow to change everything overnight, but small steps lead to much bigger things.\n\nI hope you’re feeling a little more in control after completing this list!

The pressures that black people face related to handling responsibilities at work and home and with family and friends can lead to anxiety. Feeling like you have to work twice as hard to be recognized or that you have to do everything perfectly for fear that a mistake will not only reflect badly on you but on your entire race is anxiety provoking. Further, worrying about your physical and emotional safety and weathering the jabs of micro-aggressions is exhausting and can lead us to be on edge. \n\nWhile anxiety is an understandable response to these difficult circumstances, it is associated with increases in cortisol (stress hormone), which can cause our bodies to function poorly over time. [Understanding our anxiety and learning to manage it](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-diffuse-everyday-anxiety/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) while we work to change the systems and circumstances that make us more likely to experience stress is essential for our health and well-being.\n\n## What is anxiety?\n\nAnxiety involves being preoccupied with negative thoughts about the future. Unlike depression, which usually involves ruminating about things that have already happened, with anxiety our minds act as negative forecasters, usually predicting disasters. There are physical symptoms that often accompany anxiety such as tightness in your chest, your heart racing, headaches, an upset stomach, sweaty palms, etc. Anxiety often causes us to avoid situations that we are particularly worried about. \n\nFor example, when people have social anxiety and worry about the judgments of others, they often respond by declining invitations and avoiding social situations. When people have anxiety about their work performance, they might procrastinate until they have no choice but to rush to complete a task or they might overwork and never take breaks. Anxiety can also disrupt our sleep; if you find your mind racing at night when you’re trying to fall asleep, this might be a signal that you are experiencing anxiety.\n\n![anxiety](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LS37EMBkkQ6YcEqCCw8OA/17309306c5e0f289958558ef9ae0732a/anxiety.jpeg)\n\n## What causes anxiety?\n\nIn some ways, anxiety is evolutionarily adaptive. Our ancestors on the plains in Africa who ran away when they heard a rustle in the bush without waiting to see if that rustle was caused by a lion, survived and passed their genes on to us. With that said, it's important to distinguish between anxiety that's based on real threats and anxiety that we create through our thoughts. Some anxiety is an important signal that we might not be safe and should be listened to (e.g. getting an icky feeling about the guy who’s offering to walk you to your car after you leave the club). Other kinds of anxiety can be caused by worrying about things that likely will not come to fruition (e.g. thinking “If I speak up in a meeting at work and I say the wrong thing everyone will think I’m a complete idiot”). When we get caught up in negative thoughts, our body responds as if we are in danger and we become physiologically activated (e.g. heart racing, stomach ache, headaches etc.).\n\n> Understanding the underlying causes of our anxiety can help us to be more compassionate with ourselves as we work to overcome it.\n\n## How to manage anxiety\n\n__<p>1. Work to understand what’s causing your anxiety</p>__\n\nAlthough I don’t recommend analyzing your anxiety in the middle of it, once you are calm, it can be helpful to reflect on the underlying fears or beliefs that are causing it. For me, anxiety is most often connected to romantic relationships. Through therapy, I learned that my fear that I am unlovable drives my relationship anxiety. At any hint of rejection, my mind pulls me down a rabbit hole of questions about what I did wrong and how the person I’m dating must not like me or be preparing to leave me. Understanding this core fear and being able to challenge it has been an essential part of me healing from anxiety. \n\nTherapy can be very helpful with this process. If you do not feel ready or able to seek therapy you might try talking to a close friend or family member about what tends to make you anxious and what your fears are. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone about it yet, try journaling and seeing if you can identify the themes of your worries.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying causes of our anxiety can help us to be more compassionate with ourselves as we work to overcome it. Most of us developed negative core beliefs and fears because of difficult or traumatic experiences in the past. Anxiety can develop as a method of self-protection. For example, your anxiety might protect you from rejection or disappointment by causing you to avoid a relationship or applying to a job. In the long run, these strategies don't protect us from pain and often keep us from living vibrant lives, which is why we’ve got to learn to do things differently.\n\n---\n<center> *For more tips to help reduce anxiety, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily text messages from Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n__<p>2. Let go of your negative thoughts</p>__\n\nBelieving everything that your mind says, especially the negative and self-critical things, is unhelpful. In therapy, when I’m encouraging clients to let go of their negative thoughts, they often argue that they don’t want to let their thoughts go because they believe they are true. I encourage you to shift away from focusing on whether or not your thoughts are true, to considering whether or not holding on to your thoughts is helpful. Overly critical thoughts often make us feel bad and keep us from doing the things that would help us improve and feel better.\n\nExercise to let go of thoughts: Identify one of the most negative things you say to yourself and repeat the sentences below. See if you notice any difference.\n\nStart by saying the negative statement (preferably out loud) and dwell on it for a few moments.\n\nNext say: “I’m having the thought that .” Dwell on this for a few moments.\n\nNext, say: “I notice I’m having the thought that ” dwell on this for a few moments.\n\n__<p>3. Meditate</p>__\n\nResearch shows that regular meditation can help to reduce anxiety. Meditation can serve as an antidote to anxiety because anxiety is caused by getting caught up in thoughts and worries about the future and meditation is the practice of being in the present and letting go of thoughts. \n\nMeditation helps to strengthen our ability to let go of negative thoughts and [increases our ability to be in the moment](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). There are a number of ways to meditate (e.g. sitting meditation, walking meditation, yoga, etc.) and if you are interested in trying meditation, I recommend checking out Headspace, an app that provides guided meditations.\n\nI know that my anxiety will likely come and go throughout my life. However, going to therapy, understanding the causes of my anxiety, letting go of negative thoughts and meditating have significantly reduced my anxiety and helped me to manage it effectively when it arises. I hope that these suggestions will help all of you as well.\n\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Simple Ways to Lighten Up When Things Feel Heavy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-13T13:00"},"author":{"name":"21Ninety","bio":"<p>It takes 21 days to form a habit and 90 days to create a lifestyle. <a href=\"https://21ninety.com\">21Ninety</a> is the one place where women of color can come together to learn about new things in beauty, wellness and health.</p>\n<p>For more advice on working towards healthier habits and a more fulfilling lifestyle, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/21NinetyEmail\">sign up</a> for 21Ninety&#39;s daily emails.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"21ninetylogo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/PNx8P3kqCQqAEgAkMOQaM/4a478a308884404ed5f8720af7139e6d/21ninety.jpg","details":{"size":18136,"image":{"width":512,"height":512}},"fileName":"21ninety.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["anxiety","manage","ways","advice"]},"description":{"en-US":"These tips will show you 3 ways to manage your anxiety.

I didn’t even mention it to my family because I didn’t want those sad feelings to resurface.\n\nIn other words, I took the very enlightened approach of pretend it didn’t happen—one that’s about as effective as other common responses such as get angry, push people away, blame yourself, or wallow in the pain.\n\nEven for the relatively self-aware and emotionally adept, struggles can take us by surprise. But learning [healthy ways to move through adversity](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-Powerful-Ways-to-Practice-Self-Love-in-Trying-Times/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)—a collection of skills that researchers call resilience—can help us cope better and recover more quickly, or at least start heading in that direction.\n\nThe Greater Good Science Center has collected many resilience practices on our website Greater Good in Action, alongside other research-based exercises for fostering kindness, connection, and happiness. Here are 12 of those resilience practices (squeezed into five categories), which can help you confront emotional pain more skillfully.\n\n## 1. Change the narrative\n\nWhen something bad happens, we often relive the event over and over in our heads, rehashing the pain. This process is called rumination; it’s like a cognitive spinning of the wheels, and it doesn’t move us forward toward healing and growth. \n\nThe practice of Expressive Writing can move us forward by helping us gain new insights on the challenges in our lives. It involves free writing continuously for 20 minutes about an issue, exploring your deepest thoughts and feelings around it. The goal is to get something down on paper, not to create a memoir-like masterpiece.\n\nA 1988 study found that participants who did Expressive Writing for four days were healthier six weeks later and happier up to three months later, when compared to people who wrote about superficial topics. In writing, the researchers suggest, we’re forced to confront ideas one by one and give them structure, which may lead to new perspectives. We’re actually crafting our own life narrative and gaining a sense of control.\n\n![writing - resilience](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/7mtaN6XH1YkECSKYEi6QUK/d34bbb46e7d61a78719c61c99c106437/writing_-_resilience.jpg)\n\n<center>*Source: Create Her* </center> \n\n\nOnce we’ve explored the dark side of an experience, we might choose to contemplate some of its upsides. Finding Silver Linings invites you to call to mind an upsetting experience and try to list three positive things about it. For example, you might reflect on how fighting with a friend brought some important issues out into the open, and allowed you to learn something about their point of view. \n\nIn a 2014 study, doing this practice daily for three weeks helped participants become more engaged with life afterward, and it decreased their pessimistic beliefs over time. This wasn’t true for a group whose members just wrote about their daily activities. It was particularly beneficial for staunch pessimists, who also became less depressed. But the effects wore off after two months, suggesting that looking on the bright side is something we have to practice regularly.\n\n> We can’t talk ourselves out of such fears; instead, we have to tackle the emotions directly.\n\n## 2. Face your fears\n\nThe practices above are helpful for past struggles, ones that we’ve gained enough distance from to be able to get some perspective. But what about knee-shaking fears that we’re experiencing in the here and now?\n\nThe [Overcoming a Fear](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) practice is designed to help with everyday fears that get in the way of life, such as the fear of public speaking, heights, or flying. We can’t talk ourselves out of such fears; instead, we have to tackle the emotions directly.\n\nThe first step is to slowly, and repeatedly, expose yourself to the thing that scares you—in small doses. For example, people with a fear of public speaking might try talking more in meetings, then perhaps giving a toast at a small wedding. Over time, you can incrementally increase the challenge until you’re ready to nail that big speech or TV interview.\n\nIn a 2010 study, researchers modeled this process in the lab. They gave participants a little electrical shock every time they saw a blue square, which soon became as scary as a tarantula to an arachnophobe. But then, they showed the blue square to participants without shocking them. Over time, the participants’ Pavlovian fear (measured by the sweat on their skin) gradually evaporated.\n\nIn effect, this kind of “exposure therapy” helps us change the associations we have with a particular stimulus. If we’ve flown 100 times and the plane has never crashed, for example, our brain (and body) start to learn that it’s safe. Though the fear may never be fully extinguished, we’ll likely have greater courage to confront it. \n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for Shine for more advice to help you build resilience.*</center>\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practice self-compassion\n\nI’ve never been a good flyer myself, and it was comforting when an acquaintance shared an article he wrote about having the same problem (and his favorite tips). Fears and adversity can make us feel alone; we wonder why we’re the only ones feeling this way, and what exactly is wrong with us. In these situations, learning to practice self-compassion—and recognizing that everyone suffers—can be a much gentler and more effective road to healing.\n\nSelf-compassion involves [offering compassion to ourselves](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-this-shine-squad-member-stopped-comparing-himself-to-others/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog): confronting our own suffering with an attitude of warmth and kindness, without judgment. In one study, participants in an eight-week Mindful Self-Compassion program reported more mindfulness and life satisfaction, with lower depression, anxiety, and stress afterward compared to people who didn’t participate—and the benefits lasted up to a year.\n\nOne practice, the Self-Compassion Break, is something you can do any time you start to feel overwhelmed by pain or stress. It has three steps, which correspond to the three aspects of self-compassion:\nBe mindful: Without judgment or analysis, notice what you’re feeling. Say, “This is a moment of suffering” or “This hurts” or “This is stress.”\n\nRemember that you’re not alone: Everyone experiences these deep and painful human emotions, although the causes might be different. Say to yourself, “Suffering is a part of life” or “We all feel this way” or “We all struggle in our lives.”\n\n> Self-compassion involves offering compassion to ourselves: confronting our own suffering with an attitude of warmth and kindness.\n\n\nBe kind to yourself: Put your hands on your heart and say something like “May I give myself compassion” or “May I accept myself as I am” or “May I be patient.”\n\nIf being kind to yourself is a challenge, an exercise called How Would You Treat a Friend? could help. Here, you compare how you respond to your own struggles—and the tone you use—with how you respond to a friend’s. Often, this comparison unearths some surprising differences and valuable reflections: Why am I so harsh on myself, and what would happen if I weren’t?\n\nOnce we start to develop a kinder attitude toward ourselves, we can crystallize that gentle voice in a Self-Compassionate Letter. This practice asks you to spend 15 minutes writing words of understanding, acceptance, and compassion toward yourself about a specific struggle that you feel ashamed of—say, being shy or not spending enough time with your kids. In the letter, you might remind yourself that everyone struggles, and that you aren’t solely responsible for this shortcoming; if possible, you could also consider constructive ways to improve in the future.\n\n## 4. Meditate\n\nAs mindfulness gurus like to remind us, our most painful thoughts are usually about the past or the future: We regret and ruminate on things that went wrong, or we get anxious about things that will. When we pause and bring our attention to the present, we often find that things are…okay.\n\nPracticing mindfulness brings us more and more into the present, and it offers techniques for dealing with negative emotions when they arise. That way, instead of getting carried away into fear, anger, or despair, we can work through them more deliberately.\n\nOne of the most commonly studied mindfulness programs is the eight-week-long Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which teaches participants to cope with challenges using a variety of meditation practices (including the ones detailed below). Various studies have found that MBSR has wide-ranging health and psychological benefits for people in general, as well as those struggling with mental illness or chronic disease.\n\nOne meditation that might be particularly effective at calming our negative thoughts is the Body Scan. Here, you focus on each body part in turn—head to toe—and can choose to let go of any areas of tension you discover. Strong feelings tend to manifest physically, as tight chests or knotted stomachs, and relaxing the body is one way to begin dislodging them. \n\n> Practicing mindfulness brings us more and more into the present, and it offers techniques for dealing with negative emotions when they arise. \n\nIn one study, researchers found that time spent practicing the Body Scan was linked to greater well-being and less reactivity to stress. Being more aware of our bodies—and the emotions they are feeling—might also help us make healthier choices, trusting our gut when something feels wrong or avoiding commitments that will lead to exhaustion.\n\nWhen stress creeps in, good habits often creep out—and one of those is healthy eating. When we’re emotional, many of us reach for the sweets; when we’re short on time, fast food seems like the only option. So in addition to helping us cultivate mindfulness, the Raisin Meditation could help change our relationship to food.\n\nThis exercise invites you to eat a raisin mindfully—but wait, not so fast. First, examine its wrinkles and color; see how it feels between your fingers, and then take a sniff. Slowly place it on your tongue, and roll it around in your mouth before chewing one bite at a time. Notice the urge to swallow, and whether you can sense it moving down your throat into your stomach. Not only will you have practiced mindfulness, but you may never look at food the same way again.\n\nOne final meditation that we can sprinkle throughout our day—or practice on its own—is Mindful Breathing. It involves bringing attention to the physical sensations of the breath: the air moving through the nostrils, the expansion of the chest, the rise and fall of the stomach. If the mind wanders away, you bring attention back. This can be done during a full 15-minute meditation, or during a moment of stress with just a few breaths.\n\nIn one study, participants who did a Mindful Breathing exercise before looking at disturbing images—like spiders or car crashes—experienced less negative emotion than people who hadn’t done the exercise. Negative thoughts can pull us along into their frantic stream, but the breath is an anchor we can hold onto at any time.\n\n## 5. Cultivate forgiveness\n\nIf holding a grudge is holding you back, research suggests that cultivating forgiveness could be beneficial to your mental and physical health. If you feel ready to begin, it can be a powerful practice.\n\nBoth Nine Steps to Forgiveness and Eight Essentials When Forgiving offer a list of guidelines to follow. In both cases, you begin by clearly acknowledging what happened, including how it feels and how it’s affecting your life right now. Then, you make a commitment to forgive, which means letting go of resentment and ill will for your own sake; forgiveness doesn’t mean letting the offender off the hook or even reconciling with them. Ultimately, you can try to find a positive opportunity for growth in the experience: Perhaps it alerted you to something you need, which you may have to look for elsewhere, or perhaps you can now understand other people’s suffering better.\n\nIf you’re having trouble forgiving, Letting Go of Anger through Compassion is a five-minute forgiveness exercise that could help you get unstuck. Here, you spend a few minutes generating feelings of compassion toward your offender; she, too, is a human being who makes mistakes; he, too, has room for growth and healing. Be mindfully aware of your thoughts and feelings during this process, and notice any areas of resistance.\n\nNot convinced this is the best approach? Researchers tested it against the common alternatives—either ruminating on negative feelings or repressing them—and found that cultivating compassion led participants to report more empathy, positive emotions, and feelings of control. That’s an outcome that victims of wrongdoing deserve, no matter how we feel about the offenders.\n\nStress and struggles come in many forms in life: adversity and trauma, fear and shame, betrayals of trust. The 12 practices above can help you cope with difficulties when they arise, but also prepare you for challenges in the future. With enough practice, you’ll have a toolbox of techniques that come naturally—a rainy-day fund for the mind, that will help keep you afloat when times get tough. Just knowing that you’ve built up your skills of resilience can be a great comfort, and even a happiness booster.\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Back Your Me-Time](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-12T11:00"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"description":{"en-US":"These five strategies backed by science will help you build resilience.

Every day, we are surrounded by other humans. Strangers. Hundreds of lives, hundreds of beating hearts, hundreds of stories. People starting new jobs, feeling insecure, bringing home a new baby, finding out their mother just passed away, falling in love, making ends meet-- we're all just trying to figure life out. We're in this together. \n\nHere are some quick and easy tips on how you can bridge the gap. Ways in which YOU can help foster human connection simply by being kind!\n\n## 1. Look for the Little Things. \nIf you keep your head up and your eyes peeled for moments to reach out to others or to lend a helping hand, you’ll find that the opportunities are endless. When it comes to making an impact on a stranger’s life, it doesn’t require a grand gesture. It can be something as simple as letting a car cut in front of you while in gridlock traffic or holding the door for someone as you're leaving the doctor’s office. Simple, kind gestures have the ability to change someone’s day, and ultimately their life. Your act of kindness might be the only kind human interaction they have all day and that moment that you create could be the one thing they needed to feel empowered! Your kind gesture will also have a [positive effect on your own life](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) as well. Being kind feels good!\n\n\n> If we thought about that as we came across strangers throughout the day, we’d be a lot more understanding and compassionate.\n\n## 2. Pay It Forward. \n\nAn intentional act of kindness has the potential of having a huge ripple effect. When a stranger does something kind, it can inspire the recipient of that action to then pay it forward. Here are some easy ways you can take action and spread kindness across your community:\n\n<p>1. Pay for a person’s coffee in line behind you.</p>\n\n<p>2. Add extra money to the parking meter before you leave. </p>\n\n<p>3. Take a few minutes to put all the shopping carts back in the parking lot at the grocery store. </p>\n\n<p>4. Look into local nonprofits and volunteer.</p>\n\n<p>5. Leave an encouraging, anonymous note on a strangers car window.</p>\n\n<p>6. Choose a stranger at a restaurant and pick up their bill. Tell the waiter to let them know that this was a random act of kindness and to pay it forward!</p>\n\n<p>7. Leave flowers on a strangers doorstep with an encouraging note or quote, and inform them to pay it forward!</p>\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for more life advice from Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n![buying coffee](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2YvYZkH6rKEIYSemwOugkc/e66d2ca07a4c437358da721886d3da91/buying_coffee.jpg)<center><font color=\"#D3D3D3\">Jacob Hund /Shutterstock.com</font></center>\n\n\n## 3. Put Yourself In Other's Shoes. \n\nEveryone has a story. You have no idea what someone is walking out into the world with every morning, and what they go home to at the end of their day. Every single person you encounter has [gone through something traumatic](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-things-to-tell-yourself-in-tough-moments/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). Maybe they are right now. Maybe the person who cut you off just woke up and had their life completely changed. You just have no idea what someone is going through unless you sit down and have a conversation with them. If we thought about that as we came across strangers throughout the day, we’d be a lot more understanding and compassionate. \n\n## 4. Smile and say Hello!\n\nIt’s amazing the impact that a simple smile and \"Hello!\" at a passerby can have, not only on that person’s day, but on yours as well. Smiling releases endorphins and serotonin, so you're not only lifting someone else’s spirits, but it’s actually impacting your own chemical make-up in a positive way! Now a days, we are so glued to our phones. When you sit at the car wash waiting for your car, everyones faces are down, looking at their phones. When you're in a waiting room, no one says hi. We need to be more intentional about putting our phones down and our heads up. Instead of looking down at your phone the moment you walk into an elevator, look at the person you are sharing the ride with, smile and say hello! That tiny change in habit can have such a huge impact on both of your lives!\n\n[READ NEXT: Why *JUST* Is the Most Unfair Word\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/why-just-is-the-most-unfair-word/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"kind campaign header","description":"kind campaign header","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/55u3nsPQKA2IKmgCGgOImI/2c0b85c1629607fad445e5273931588f/Kind_Campaign.jpg","details":{"size":230994,"image":{"width":984,"height":374}},"fileName":"Kind Campaign.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-10T14:00"},"author":{"name":"Kind Campaign","bio":"<p><strong>Kind Campaign</strong> is the leading nonprofit ending the trend of  girl-on-girl bullying.

Estimate the time and energy you currently spend in each list, and decide what’s the ideal balance.</p>\n\n_* I've prepared a downloaded worksheet for you at the end of this post._\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*GnZBKhoppwWphdBc2ub1XA.jpeg\" /><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*RydJJ3zTkiPuf50ymqTiwA.jpeg\" />\n\n## Why is it called the 4 buckets?\n\nBecause relationships are like gardening; you reap what you sow. To be a good gardener you need to make sure that the soil is healthy and the conditions are right for life to flourish, to select the right plants to nurture, to ensure that new seedlings are planted and the weeds are plucked consistently.\n\nYou need an overview of how much land you have to work with, how fertile the soil is accordingly to the year, what fertilizers to use, when to water, what types of plants you have in your garden, and the type of care they need to flourish. You do this so that you better understand how to allocate your time and energy to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\n## Bucket 1 — Evergreen 🌵\nThis is the bucket where your closest and dearest should go into. They are the most meaningful and enriching relationships in your life, however you define that. Together, the people here form the core of your social circle. They are the people who you can expect to lean on in hard times, and hopefully, people whom you’d do the same for in return.\n\nEvergreen relationships, like evergreen trees, maintain their foliage and cover throughout the year, and can reduce chilling winds in the winter and provide shade in the summer. Evergreen relationships are deep and lasting, defensible and weatherproof, and this is an bucket that you should be investing the bulk of your time and effort.\n\n## Bucket 2 — Grow 🌿\nThis bucket serves to grow under developed relationships, both existing and new. Ideally, in every relationship the give-and-take ratio is somewhat balanced. In reality, however, there is usually an imbalance at any given time or phase; there’ll be a party who is giving more, and sometimes that person who needs to step up is you.\n\nThose that go into this bucket could be people who you are interested in developing a deeper relationship with, or it can also be people whom you have neglected and would like to repair and restore your relationships with them. By hanging onto deadweight or relationships that are underserved, you are doing both yourself and the other person a disservice.\n\n## Bucket 3 — Plant 🌱\nThis is the bucket where you seed new relationships. These are people whom you think might have potential to blossom into something meaningful. Maybe it’s the cute guy/girl you met at the party, or the new colleague at your at your new job.\n\nInterestingly, this is the bucket where it can deliver the biggest payoff. Since you’re in exploration mode here, the chances of surprises are inherently built-in. For example, some of my closest friends and collaborators in recent years have seemingly popped out of nowhere, serendipitously. Spending time in this bucket, even though not always comfortable, can be hugely rewarding.\n\n## Bucket 4 — Prune ✂️\nThis is a highly important bucket. It’s where you give yourself permission to [let go of relationships](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-break-up-with-a-toxic-friend/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), or to free yourself yourself from negative ones that are pulling you back. By frequently removing negative and stale relationships, you keep your social circle fresh and vibrant, and are able to create new opportunities for new ones to develop, by redirecting time and energy into the first three buckets, the ones that deserve it.\n\n## Why prune and how to choose which relationships to prune.\nLife is too short to constantly invest in relationships that don’t make us happy. Identifying these relationships is the first step in liberating yourself from them.\n\n> “A friend to all is a friend to none.” — Aristotle.\n\n## 3 criteria I use for pruning relationships\nI use a rule of three for every relationship: I will invest in taking three initiatives on my part to explore the relationship. If nothing comes out of those exploration efforts or if I’m disappointed thrice then this is a rule for giving myself permission to de-prioritize those relationships so I can focus on those that matters.\n\n<p>1. __Flaky, unresponsive, no initiated effort.__ These are the people whom you feel are not / have not been giving back to the relationship. Maybe they are flaky, maybe they are unresponsive, or maybe they are just in general not taking an active role in developing your relationship.</p>\n<p>2. __Toxic and negative. __These are the people I find draining to be around. Maybe they’re always complaining, maybe they’re always hating, maybe they are transactional and manipulative. It depends on how you define toxic and negative.</p>\n<p>3. __A lack of space, energy, or desire from your part.__ We need to stop saying “Let’s meet up sometime!” if we don’t have intention of actually following through. These “open-commitment loops” are insidiously draining. Imagine running multiple tabs simultaneously on your Internet browser. Individually, these tabs may not seem like much but cumulatively, they really add up have a huge impact on your processing power.</p>\n\n<center>![how to choose who to spend your time with tweet](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1TRSPgXzd2SwYgOmGQIySI/7fd072ce2f564ee55ad295ba70887843/how_to_choose_who_to_spend_your_time_with_tweet.png)</center>\n\nIf you’re not burning for it, don’t do it.

Whatever your strengths and weaknesses are, you probably already have a good sense of it. What the 4 Buckets help you to do is to see more clearly how you might negotiate a more sustainable balance between them.\n\nFor example, most people I know (including myself) find it easier to hang out with familiar faces (Bucket 1) than to be out there meeting new people consistently (Bucket 3). As tempting as it is to only do the things that we love and which come most naturally and easily to us, a full life is a varied and diverse one and not some narrow experience of a single element.\n\n## Our Need For Consistency\nJust like our in-built sense of fairness and the need to be connected with others, psychologists say that it’s a human characteristic that we are driven to be consistent in all areas of life; our attitudes, values, habits, and promises. We want to be consistent ourselves and we want others to be consistent. It’s an essential fundamental quality to cultivate across all aspects of our life.\n\nIf you think about it, what are regrets if not the accumulation of missed opportunities; where we consistently failed to do what we really should have done. Regrets such as “I wish that I had let myself be happier” is not so much as being happy once or a few times, but more about being happier consistently over the course of their lives.\n\nThis dovetails perfectly with one of my biggest insights in the last few years: I feel happiest and most at peace when I’m focusing my time and energy on [what truly matters to me](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). In other words, I feel best when what I do is consistent with what I believe.\n\n## Choose Well To Live Well\nImagine a reality with less guilt and regret because you’re secured in the comfort that your actions are aligned with your most deeply cherished values and beliefs.\n\nA reality where you strike a better balance between exploring new relationships and enjoying the familiar ones, where you no longer worry about somewhere else you could be or someone better to be with, because you know you are exactly where you need to be. A reality where you experience tranquility and happiness more consistently.\n\nDoesn’t that sound nice? And to think, all you have to do is to begin by imagining your friends as plants and then compulsively ordering them into lists :D\n\nInterested in doing this for yourself?

The way you start your morning can dictate how to rest of your day will go, so here are a few things you can do to have a tangle-free morning.\n\n## Meditate or pray  \nThe world is so fast paced nowadays that it’s hard to be still. However, it’s very important to rest your mind, body and spirit every day. The best way to practice being still is meditating and praying. It is found that [doing these practices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-schiffman/why-people-who-pray-are-heathier_b_1197313.html) increases dopamine, the happy chemical.\n\n## Set an intention \nWhen you wake up, set an intention for your day. Do you want to be productive? Connect with people? Dedicate this day to self-love? Whatever the case, speaking your purpose helps you set the tone for the day. [Shine](http://shinetext.com) is a free resource you can use to help you set your intentions.\n\n## Workout \n\nToo tired to hit the gym after work? Try working out in the morning instead. Putting exercise first on your to-do list can energize you, [boost your metabolism](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/8-benefits-to-working-out-in-the-morning.html), and help you stay focused throughout the day.\n\n## Start journaling\nI’ve been journaling since the time I was able to write. Have I been consistent? Nope. But whenever I needed to vent or had an idea, journaling has helped me out. The practice helps relieve physical and mental stress, which in turn can [remove mental blockages](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-health-benefits-of-journaling/) or decrease the symptoms of arthritis and asthma.\n\n## Drink tea or warm lemon-infused water \nSleep can dehydrate you. Wake up your system by pouring a nice cup of tea or warm lemon water. The [benefits are endless,](http://wellnessmama.com/35192/benefits-of-lemon-water/) such as helping you maintain a healthy weight and boosting your immune system.\n\n## Make a green juice or smoothie \nAnother way to wake your system up is to drink something green! Green juices and smoothies have many benefits, such as boosting energy and promoting healthy hair, skin and nails. Don’t know whether to choose between making a juice or a smoothie? Well, your body absorbs nutrients faster when you drink a green juice, while green smoothies are more filling due to high fiber content. Here’s a dope green juice recipe to get you started.\n\n## Listen to motivational videos or audio \nSometimes you need an extra boost of inspiration. Why not listen to your favorite podcast or motivational YouTube while you're getting ready to start the day? My personal favorites right now are [The Friends Zone](https://soundcloud.com/thefriendzonepodcast), and [Brittspiration](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA-l-m6U_5iaSs8o4oOmkYA) by Brittany Josephina.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFoWKuIir7Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDo one or all of these practices to have a more purposeful morning.\n\n[READ NEXT: How to Spring Clean Your Whole Life](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"7 ways to start your morning","description":"7 ways to start your morning","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/65oC6wNBjGo0m4eM4SmgWe/15d4402438d99c7e0aea6a64bf1c0f10/7_ways_to_start_your_morning.jpg","details":{"size":191542,"image":{"width":1000,"height":525}},"fileName":"7 ways to start your morning.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-04-03T13:00"},"author":{"name":"21Ninety","bio":"<p>It takes 21 days to form a habit and 90 days to create a lifestyle. 21Ninety is the one place where women of color can come together to learn about new things in beauty, wellness and health.</p>\n<p>For more advice on working towards healthier habits and a more fulfilling lifestyle, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/21NinetyEmail\">sign up</a> for 21Ninety&#39;s daily emails.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"21ninetylogo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/PNx8P3kqCQqAEgAkMOQaM/4a478a308884404ed5f8720af7139e6d/21ninety.jpg","details":{"size":18136,"image":{"width":512,"height":512}},"fileName":"21ninety.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"tags":{"en-US":["morning","productivity","advice","routine"]},"description":{"en-US":"These tips will help you start the day off on the right foot.

How about the last time you looked at your list and actually wanted to do everything on it?\n\nEarlier [this spring](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), I started getting loads of requests for help managing too-long task lists, and so I published this process for organizing them. Ineffective task lists make us feel like we have too much to do in too little time, which makes us feel overwhelmed. Ironically, this makes us worse at planning and managing our time.\n\nYou might have a perfectly organized task list, though, that is still triggering overwhelm—I just went through one with a client, and frankly I was exhausted just looking at it. If your task list is sending you into an “I don’t have enough time to do all this” tailspin, it’s time to whittle that puppy down into something more manageable.\n\nThis is a different process than organizing your to-do list, or formatting it in a more effective way. This is about [shortening that list—dumping](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-best-ways-to-create-structure-in-your-day/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) the stuff you dread—without suffering the consequences of not doing what you actually have to do to get done.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would all be able to apply Marie Kondo’s world-famous principles for cleaning out our closet to our to-do list: Anything that doesn’t “spark joy” we put in the trash (delete) or give away (delegate). Most of my clients start off with very little on their task list that they look forward to doing; one recently declared that she only puts stuff on her to-do list that she doesn’t want to do, because she remembers to do what she actually wants to do.\n\nSo here’s how to transform a too-long to-do list into a list of only the things that you actually want to do:\n\n## 1. Highlight all the items on your to-do list that you dread doing\n\nHold each task list item in your mind’s eye, and notice how it feels to think about doing that item in your body. Do you lean forward a little, feeling a longing to get right to that task? (Don’t highlight items that feel like that.) Or do you get a sinking feeling in your stomach, with a corresponding desire to put the task off as long as possible? Highlight anything that makes you feel anything akin to aversion.\n\nHighlight all the things that you’ve been procrastinating on because you simply don’t want to do them. And highlight the things that are on your list because you feel like you “should” do them, or because you feel like you have to do them, but that you don’t want to do or wouldn’t say you are choosing to do (or wouldn’t say with some delight that you “get” to do).\n\n> Start by deleting, then move on to delegating. \n\nIn other words, highlight the things you plan to do simply because someone expects you to do them, or because you’ve always expected yourself to do those things, or because doing them would bring you status or power (but no actual joy in the process).\n\n## 2. Delete or delegate as many highlighted items as you possibly can\n\nStart by deleting, then move on to delegating. Be truthful here; if you know in your heart of hearts that you’ll probably never do a task item anyway, or that there will be little consequence if you don’t do a highlighted item on your list, just scratch it off the list and be done with it.\n\nYou may feel relieved, or even accomplished (given that your list is getting shorter so quickly!). Or, you may feel anxious or even sad while doing this. Acknowledge your emotions, whatever they may be, as you madly delete items from your task list. Be curious about whatever you are feeling, and accepting of your emotions—but no need to get involved in them.\n\nMaybe you need to mourn (a little tiny bit) the fact that you are never going to make those photo albums (that you hate making but really felt like you should make). It’s normal to feel sad, or a sense of regret—but also, be real: You aren’t grieving anything tangible; you’re grieving the loss of a fantasy. For example, you’re giving up the fantasy that you are the type of person who makes photo albums. Or who writes strategic plans. Or who answers every single email. Oh, well. Let yourself feel what you feel, and move on. This is a process of letting go.\n\nIf a highlighted task is something that absolutely does need to be done and thus can’t just be deleted, try to think of someone else who’d actually enjoy doing it, and make a plan for how you can delegate it to that person. If you don’t have an assistant or employees or children to delegate to, consider neighborhood teens and retirees who’d like experience, your company, or a little extra cash. Or, think of people who need help with something you enjoy doing, and negotiate a trade with them.\n\n> Understanding the value a task has for other people is another good way to make it more fulfilling \n\nAll of this may seem like a lot more work than just doing the task yourself, but I promise, you will thank me later. Having a task list that is both short enough to not be overwhelming and that is loaded with things you’ll enjoy doing is worth the initial inefficiency.\n\n## 3. Transform anything left on your list that is highlighted into something that you actually want to do\n\nIf you can’t delete or delegate tasks that you dread, then you’ll have to make them better. Be creative. My favorite way to do this is to pair a not-fun task item with something you want to do more of. I’ve been known to sit on the lawn in the sun and make doctor appointments, and I listen to fun audiobooks while driving to pick up kids and while cleaning the house (I just listened to A Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes and I highly recommend it). My co-worker and I have been putting off reviewing our financial systems for, oh, years, but we just made a plan to do it together this summer poolside. There will be margaritas involved, and, needless to say, we aren’t dreading the task anymore!\n\nUnderstanding the value a task has for other people is another good way to make it more fulfilling (thus decreasing the dread factor). In a stunning series of studies, Adam Grant found that briefly showing people how their work helps others increases not only how happy people are on the job but also how much they work and accomplish.\n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for Shine for more advice to help you thrive.*</center>\n\n---\n\n\nGrant’s most famous series of studies were conducted at a call center with paid fundraisers tasked with phoning potential donors to a public university. As anyone who’s ever dreaded making a cold call knows, these people probably did not have the to-do list of their dreams. People receiving cold calls from solicitors are often annoyed and can be downright rude. Employees must endure frequent rejection on the phone and low morale at the office—all in exchange for relatively low pay. Not surprisingly, call center jobs often have a high staff turnover rate.\n\nIn an effort to see if he could motivate call center fundraisers to stay on the job longer, Grant brought in a few scholarship students (who presumably had benefited from the fundraisers’ work) for a five-minute meeting where callers could ask them questions about their classes and experience at the university. In the next month, that quick conversation yielded unbelievable results. Callers who had met the scholarship students spent twice as long on the phone as the fundraisers who had not met any students. They accomplished far more, bringing in an average of 171 percent more money.\n\nWhat made the difference? What, essentially, shifted the task of making cold calls from one people didn’t enjoy to one that they did? A shift in the callers’ beliefs about the meaning of their work for other people, and an increased sense of their purpose, value, and impact. So find out what value your work has for other people. How are you making their lives or jobs better?\n\nVoila!\n\nYou’ve just Marie Kondo-ed your task list!

It also signals that it’s time for spring cleaning, which we’ve traditionally defined as a deep cleaning for our houses or apartments. \n\nBut why not try something new this year, like expanding our spring cleaning beyond just our homes? Instead, let’s include every part of our lives — like our minds, bodies, relationships, as well as our homes and offices. How’s that for self-care?\n\nResearch has shown the positive effects of decluttering both physically and mentally. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228167) showed that clearing clutter makes us more creative and productive and less irritable and distracted. Let’s not forget about our mental clutter as well, like those destructive and distressing thoughts, feelings, and memories that we tend to carry around with us. [Researchers also found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156028/) that replacing those negative thoughts with positive ones immediately opens us up to see more possibilities for ourselves, and equips us to better plan for the future.\n\nSo if you're truly ready for something new, here’s what you can do to make the most of your spring cleaning this year.\n\n## 1. Create Space For New Energy\nOur homes are often extensions of ourselves, and the primary places for stale, old energy to become trapped. Target these specific spots to release the bad vibes and make room for something new.\n\n![Why *Just* ](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1UtIGF0VhqmMCWwIGm6CAS/143df7cb18a16afc7ac58d3dd20c7f19/JUST.jpeg)\n\n### __Your closet.__ \nSay goodbye once and for all to those pieces of clothing that no longer reflect who you are today. Donate them to someone who would be happy to have and use them, like a relative, your neighbors, or a local charity. \n\n### __Your kitchen.__\nRid your fridge and your cabinets (and your secret snack drawer) of the stuff that doesn’t make you feel like your best self. Create room to stock up on what fills you and fuels you. \n\n### __Your desk.__ \nEmbrace your trash bin as a tool to let go of what’s blocking you, like those mounting piles of paper. Instead, go digital. File your documents in an online storage service like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or Dropbox. Use your newly-cleared desk to showcase things that calm you, inspire you and keep you motivated.\n\n## 2. Clear Your Head\nLeave old baggage behind, in favor of increased clarity, greater possibilities, and a more positive outlook overall. \n\n### __Start a journal.__\nWrite down your thoughts and reflections, so that you don’t have to carry them around in your head. Try [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for note-taking on the go, which means you won’t have to carry around paper or pens either. \n\n### __Meditate.__\nRelease mental clutter for good through meditation, using an app like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) to guide you through. Or try other forms of energy work, such as reiki or chakra healing. Go with what works for you.\n\n### __Quiet the noise.__\nWe all love our phones, but the constant buzzing, beeping, and ringing can add unnecessary chatter to our already crowded thoughts. Uninstall the apps that you never really cared for, leaving only the ones that you enjoy and use the most. At the very least, turn off those annoying notifications. \n\n### __Refresh your inbox.__\nTake back control of your inbox by unsubscribing from the many email lists that you’re on, but can’t remember why or how. Use [Unroll.me](https://unroll.me/) for easy and painless unsubscribing and categorizing of your subscriptions, so that the messages you see are the ones you actually care about.\n\n\n## 3. Reset Your Routines\n\nGive yourself a fresh start when it comes to your time and commitments. \n\n![kelly-jean-200248](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1QjDKmvTm82yEmCY6SMmG6/600bcb1d84bfcbcca1ceb2000c69966c/kelly-jean-200248.jpg)\n\n### __Maximize your time.__ \nRework your morning ritual to boost your energy and help you conquer your most important goals each day. Create a nighttime routine that includes ample time to unwind, rest, and set yourself up for a success the following morning. \n\n### __Put you first.__\nLet go of outdated obligations, goals, and habits. Replace them with new intentions that match who you are now and where you are headed. Then try an app like [Any.do](http://www.any.do/) to help you stay on track. \n\n\n## 4. Reconnect To What You Love\nAs an act of self-care, create space for the people and things that light you up and keep you moving forward.\n\n### __Your people.__\nPrioritize the positive figures in your life, by making time to nurture and grow those relationships. That said, take back your time and energy from those relationships that are no longer serving you.\n\n### __Your passions.__\nSchedule some time to get lost in an activity that you love and enjoy. Set boundaries for work, and grant yourself time to play as well. \n\n---\n\n<center> *[Join](http://www.shinetext.com/squad/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) our VIP community The Shine Squad for free swag, networking opportunities, good vibes, and more! *</center>\n\n---\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"title":{"en-US":"How To Spring Clean Your Whole Life"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-03-27T08:00"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["refresh","renew","spring clean"]},"description":{"en-US":"Out with the old, in with the...nothing?"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"author":{"name":"Uzy Igweatu","bio":"<p>Uzy Igweatu is the founder of <a href=\"http://thisisbbm.com/\">Brand Belle Media</a>, a strategic brand consultancy that helps executives and entrepreneurs build powerful brand identities and create lasting connections with consumers.

I’m open to possibility, which was my highest objective for this break. I crave space, [quiet and beauty to be inspired](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/shine-squad-feature-ninas-4-tips-to-slow-down-and-enjoy-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) (no small feat in a big city!). I am reading and writing regularly. As I walk out my door, I’m excited to make new connections with people that I don’t yet know. I’m [more comfortable in my own skin](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/your-self-consciousness-is-killing-your-creativity/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) as I’m proud of all that I was able to experience while on my own during the break.\n\nAs I look back at my time in Berlin and its impact, I have gleaned insight into how I would design future sabbaticals:\n\n## The location is key. \nWhether it’s a bustling megacity or calm oceanside town, it’s important to know what kind of experience you’re looking for in your break. To get a lay of the land, it may even be worth visiting the place before you take your break there to take notes.\n\nThe space you’ll be in will have a significant influence on your experience. If you’re staying in a hotel or rented place, in a shared space or single occupancy unit or in a neighborhood with lots of sightseeing, nightlife or creature comfort amenities, all of those factors will play a huge role in how much you enjoy your break.\n\n## Identify your critical local businesses during your first week. \nThe grocery store, hardware store, pharmacy, laundromat, police/fire/emergency station and hospital/medical clinic should be part of that list. Other add-ons could include a neighborhood coffee shop, co-working space or farmers market.\n\n\n## Get a SIM card for your mobile device(s). \nNavigating a new place – with the help of a myriad of apps catered to travelers – is invaluable in making you feel comfortable in your new city/town. That said, observe and engage with all that is going on around you. This is a unique time and you’ll want to take it all in!\n\n\n## Make a friend in the neighborhood. \nIt’s always nice to know people that live nearby (even in your own building!). They can help you get a sense of the local area; they can provide helpful tips to have an authentic experience, all the while staying safe.\n\n> Live as if you’ll always be living there, not as someone just passing through.<a href=\"http://ctt.ec/7YBea\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more advice on life, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily messages from Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Live outside of your comfort zone. \nLearn a bit of the local language. Strike up conversations with people, especially those you wouldn’t normally socialize with. Explore your new home with a childlike wonder. Try new foods, customs and adopt the culture as your own. Be it a café, bookstore or any other neighborhood haunt, be a regular somewhere. Live as if you’ll always be living there, not as someone just passing through.\n\n## Try to disconnect with your life back home. \nCheck in with family and friends as much as needed but not constantly. Allocate only [certain hours of the day](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-great-possibility-of-an-unstructured-day/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) to being on social media. Remember that your time in your new home is limited and you want to absolutely make the most of it by being fully present.\n\nI will warn you – you will miss your [life break](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/taking-a-life-break-to-get-unstuck/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) home! It is a bittersweet experience returning back to your “normal” life. I even had reverse culture shock as I slowly sauntered past busy, stressed New Yorkers my first week back. Even though it was for only a month, I learned more about myself in that time than I did all year. I really loved the life I carved out for myself during the break – so much so that I plan on returning to Berlin next year to visit my new friends there.\n\nAs I was adjusting back into my life in New York (and attempting to console myself!), I stumbled on a TED talk given by Stefan Sagmeister that has been viewed over 2.7 million times. He has in his plans to take a sabbatical for one year every seven years and had done just one at the time of his talk. In it, he states that, “Basically everything we've (Sagameister, Inc., his eponymous design studio) done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year.” It was even revealed during this same TED talk that 5% of all of the attendees at the conference had done a sabbatical before.\n\nWe can try to sum up the value of a life break, qualitatively and quantitatively. In the end, I urge you to find out how valuable it is for yourself – by taking one.\n\n\n<font color=\"#808080\">*Photo Credit: James Song*</font>\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Back Your Me-Time](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<center> [We're hiring!](http://www.shinetext.com/jobs/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) </center> \n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"description":{"en-US":"Learnings and takeaways after taking a career break."},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Ji Son","description":"Ji Son ","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/34PVAdVG36qYWs4iqUWmEw/bfdc1474aaca9ceaa7d0e37108121b23/Slack_for_iOS_Upload__20_.jpg","details":{"size":812088,"image":{"width":2048,"height":1010}},"fileName":"Slack for iOS Upload (20).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"tags":{"en-US":["career break","sabbatical","advice","changed my life"]},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"date":{"en-US":"2017-03-21T13:00"},"author":{"name":"Ji Son Choi","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jschoi\">Ji Son Choi </a>is a creative strategist who collaborates with brands to bring their values and stories to life via custom content and technology.

And while there are so many magical [productivity tips](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) and tricks out there, let’s be real: Many of them don’t work.\n\nWhat’s a waste of time, and what should you be doing instead? Here are three common [productivity hacks](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) people use and what you should be doing instead. \n\n\n## 1. Myth: Multitasking Is More Productive\nAlthough it may stand to reason that listening to a podcast while messaging your best friend on Facebook about your hot date coming up on Friday and working on your biology essay while also painting your nails can help you accomplish many tasks efficiently at once, the reality is that it doesn’t. Our productivity can [decrease by as much as 40% from multitasking](https://hbr.org/2010/05/how-and-why-to-stop-multitaski), as we switch tasks and actually lose time by interrupting ourselves between tasks.\n\nReducing your amount of multitasking can lead to greater progress on projects that you have deemed challenging and have not gotten to by distracting yourself with something else, as well as decrease the stress you may feel by working often but not actually accomplishing anything. By disconnecting ourselves from our cellphones and computers when they are not necessary, we can be more mindful of the world around us and tune into the task at hand. Give yourself a deadline for the task at hand and use your electronics as an incentive for the work that you accomplish by that deadline.\n\n> Taking breaks that relieve your mind, get your oxygen flowing, and give your brain a break from one task are essential.\n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for Shine for more advice to help you thrive.*</center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2. Myth: Working as Much as Possible Gets More Done\nThe United States has a much higher rate of work hours than many countries, and often others with fewer hours in their work week tend to have [higher rates of productivity.](http://www.iamexpat.nl/read-and-discuss/expat-page/news/eu-working-hours-and-productivity)\n\nTaking breaks that relieve your mind, get your oxygen flowing, and give your brain a break from one task are essential. Using methods such as the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT70iCaG0Gs) can help you allocate your work and make sure that you give yourself a break depending on how much work you can get done and how much time you need before you can go back to working without overdoing it.\n\nRecently while attending a panel at [the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](http://www.unescap.org/events/escap-sdg-week), I had the pleasure of hearing Ernie Rebustillo, a representative from Right to Play International, talk on the importance of play and allowing ourselves to find a balance between work and play time. When play is purposeful, learning occurs, and provides us with a way to express ourselves while also encouraging critical thinking, problem solving, and literacy skills.\n\nThe idea of “play” can just be a hobby or something that makes you happy, whether it is cooking, painting, walking around outside, or having fun talking with your friends for a little while. When we allocate ourselves time to have fun and be creative, it makes our work that much more effective when we return to it, refreshed.\n\n> Rather than trying to do too much at once, allocate yourself time for work and play!\n\n## 3. Myth: Technology Makes Everything Better and Faster\nRather than using our electronic devices to constantly keep in touch through email and Facebook, connecting with others in person can often let you be more [productive](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) by giving you human contact and increasing your endorphins when you have positive interactions with others. Often, using our electronics too often in what we think are productive ways can result in us taking ourselves too seriously (not allowing us to have a break from work), being disrespectful and unkind (not communicating with people in public places, not paying attention to where we are going), or letting your tools control you (not being able to live life without your device!)\n\nRecently, I lost my cellphone while abroad in Bangkok, and it has taught me the importance of checking your electronics and making sure that they don’t control you. I have found it much easier to both be productive and social with others, as I am not constantly connected to my phone and many outside distractions which often have no relevance to the task at hand. Make sure you minimize your cell phone use when completing important tasks!\n\nRather than trying to do too much at once, allocate yourself time for work and play! Dividing work and play time allows us to be more mindful of our work, and allows our brain to have time during which it can rejuvenate without feeling overwhelmed. Unplugging from technology during these break times can allow us to reconnect with reality and those around us, enjoying nature and a world outside of human constraints.\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Back Your Me-Time](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<font color=\"#d3d3d3\"> *Photo credit: Pressmaster/Shutterstock.com* </font>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"author":{"name":"Way Up","bio":"<p>WayUp is the largest marketplace connecting college students and recent grads with job &amp; internship opportunities.

If so, you’re not alone --- even the most successful people search for and share [tips](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), tricks and [stories](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/becky-g-shares-how-self-love-helped-change-her-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) to help them become the best version of themselves and lead a happier life. \n\nThough there are tons of different strategies and tactics you can use to lift your spirits, overcome obstacles or crush your goals, one key element seems to be present in all of them: practicing gratitude. There’s a legit reason why too, as [research shows](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-amazing-way-gratitude-rewires-your-brain-for-happiness.html) that being grateful can physically change your brain and boost happiness. That’s major!\n\n> Make it a point to be fully present during your moment of appreciation, fully taking in what you love about what’s in front of you and why you enjoy it.  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/Deb6a\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\nReady for a re-wire in the name of being thankful? Read on for five tips that’ll help you make practice a regular part of your daily life.\n\n\n## 1. Start small. \nJust like when starting anything new, practicing gratitude is most effective when you start small. Instead of trying to change your entire mindset in a single day, focus on finding one tiny thing that you appreciate between the time you wake up in the morning and wind down for bed at night. This could be as simple as an awesome quality in a friend or co-worker, an afternoon snack that hits the spot, nice weather, or your favorite song on the radio at the perfect time. \n\nMake it a point to be fully present during your moment of appreciation, fully taking in what you love about what’s in front of you and why you enjoy it. Once you start honing in on the little details you missed before, you’ll begin to notice more and more greatness around you --- just like magic!\n\n\n> As Oprah beautifully says, “Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough.”  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/bI8bb\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\n---\n\n<center>*For more tips around gratitude, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily text messages from Shine.* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2. Stop comparing, right NOW. \nThough stacking yourself up against other people is seriously tempting (especially when it comes to what you see on social media), making comparisons is a huge no-no when it comes to mastering your gratitude practice. As Oprah beautifully says, “Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough.” \n\nIf you’re lost on how to quit the comparison game, try enlisting a smart, [girlboss-approved](http://www.brit.co/super-effective-ways-to-stop-comparing-yourself-to-other-women/) strategy or two. You’ll feel much more appreciative of your journey once you’ve learned to stop yourself in your tracks.\n\n## 3. Write it down. \nPick up a pencil for some old-fashioned journaling because writing down what you’re [thankful](https://www.amazon.com/thxthxthx-Goodness-Everything-Leah-Dieterich/dp/1449402941/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489436803&sr=8-1&keywords=thx+thx+thx) for is an awesome way to chronicle all of the details in your life, whether they’re big or small. In fact, writing something down is a surefire way to better remember it, which means you’ll find it easier to call up and continue to appreciate all of the special things you begin to notice on the daily. \n\nAnother bonus? Flipping through your journal can serve as a powerful reminder and instant mood enhancer anytime you’re feeling low. \n\n![write it down](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6zGQOEl1Uk4UsoaukM68cE/45d3a9352ad89110017336b9724dd45a/StockSnap_DPKNIIN5X3.jpg)\n\n\n\n## 4. Give more.\nFeeling bummed out? Try doing something nice for someone else --- not only will it brighten your mood to bring someone else joy, but you’ll probably feel ultra-grateful for your time, talents, abilities or whatever else you have to offer. Sometimes, all it takes is lending your listening ear for a few minutes or smiling to a stranger on the street. \n\nDon’t ever underestimate how much simple kindness can do; both for someone else and for your own gratitude practice. According to TIME, “[experiments show evidence](http://time.com/collection-post/4070299/secret-to-happiness/) that altruism is hardwired in the brain—and it’s pleasurable.” \n\n\n## 5. Keep it regular. \nDid you know that it takes about [66 days to form a habit](http://jamesclear.com/new-habit)? It’s true: experts agree that two months of regular practice is the average amount of time you’ll need to put in before a new behavior or pattern becomes automatic. That said, consistency is key when it comes to helping your new gratitude habit and mindset stick --- so keep looking for the mini-moments, noting the best things around you, focusing on yourself (and your goals), and giving as much of your good energy and talents to the people around you as you can. \n\nIn what will feel like little to no time at all, the stuff you need to think about now will naturally become a part of your more joyful and thankful new life.

Back then, I didn’t know that this short story contained wisdom that I would revisit 20 years later and would hope to instill into my daily life as an adult.\n\nI realized that I always rush my way through life and try to get to the “Finish Line” as soon as I can, just like the hare. Do you ever feel like that sometimes? We all live such busy lives and have to manage so many things at once: our job, our health, our relationships, our children, our pets, our home, our finances, etc. The list can go on and on.

Have you actively stopped to take in your surroundings, your senses, your thoughts, and hear your own breath? If you’re like me, this is a rare (if it even happens at all) event. I realized that I don’t know how to relax and slow down. \n\nIf you struggle with slowing down in life like me, let’s challenge ourselves to channel our inner tortoise and try to slow down a little. \n\nHere are four tips to help you take things slow to enjoy life.\n\n\n\n## 1. Spend 5-10 minutes each day doing nothing \nWHAT? How do I not do something? It’s hard because we are trained to constantly be on our feet (or mentally “on”), but this is a great way to remind yourself that [you don’t need to be busy to feel happy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-sober-up-from-your-busy-ness-addiction/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) or a sense of calm. You can even call this meditation if you want. It’s simply a time you can set to being still and giving your body and mind a break from the surrounding world. \n\nI know we are all busy and rely on our phones to keep us on track in our lives, so why not set a reminder to do this every day on your phone? Even better, use this [free Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) phone app to set a time limit for yourself so that you don’t accidentally go beyond the amount of time you have in your busy day to do this. Do you need a meditation cushion or decked out room for this? Nah. You just need some place (preferably away from all the hustle and bustle) to withdraw from your senses. Go outside your home for 5 minutes, take a walk, go into an empty room, or throw on headphones with some [calming music](http://www.calm.com) if you find that you can’t get away from noise. See additional calming apps below in #3 to use as a substitute for music.\n\n> Do you find yourself rushing to work or to get a task done? Or simply rushing through life, in general, to always get to that next step (whatever it is)?\n\n## 2. Stop and notice your surroundings \nThis is a way to be mindful in your every day. Do you find yourself rushing to work or to get a task done? Or simply rushing through life, in general, to always get to that next step (whatever it is)? Take a few moments to stop and notice your surroundings. I have found this is a great grounding tool for when I start feeling anxious and/or overwhelmed with life. \n\nAre you outside? Take a moment to describe what you see and hear, whether it’s a tree, the sound of birds, buildings, people, etc. Are you inside? Take a moment to notice the color of the walls, the color of the chair/couch you’re on, the texture of an object that is near you, or the food that you’re eating. Although it doesn’t seem like it, this is the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness doesn’t need to be done in a group meditation class, or while being guided by a teacher, it can be done at any moment. That’s the point, actually, is to be aware of the present moment. Not the past, nor the future, but the present moment.\n\n## 3. Can’t get away from your phone? Use your phone to your advantage! \nI totally understand that our phones are our connections to others and to the world. Sometimes we are “on call” to our children, our spouses, family members, etc, and turning it off simply isn’t an option. Luckily, there are a number of mindfulness phone apps out there (for free!) that give you a chance to take a mental break. Check them out [here](http://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/top-meditation-iphone-android-apps#5) and [here](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-mindfulness-apps-ranked-in-one-chart-1726392024).\n\n> Don’t rush through life and miss out on opportunities for growth because you didn’t make self-care a priority.\n\n## 4. Make time for self-care\nI can’t stress this enough, but [make self-care a priority](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/becky-g-shares-how-self-love-helped-change-her-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). Often times, the result of rushing through life is neglecting your mind, goals, health, spirituality, passion, and your overall sense of self in general. Don’t rush through life and miss out on opportunities for growth because you didn’t make self-care a priority. Taking care of yourself (mind, body, spirit) will let you be able to take effectively care of others in your life and be more present with them.\n\nSlow down and appreciate the day-to-day. Be present to yourself and to others. We don’t want to rush through life, look back, and realize we didn’t actually live. There’s something to be said about Slow and Steady, the tortoise, taking his time and winning the race. Not only that, but he probably got to take in the beautiful surroundings of the forest as he walked down the road. Let’s follow in his (webbed and clawed) footsteps and tread through life at a pace that lets us enjoy ourselves, our surroundings, our loved ones, and our life in general.

We pander to the whims of others, hoping to please everyone (or at least find few enemies). We try to behave affably, make the correct remark, and laugh at the appropriate times, all for the sake of winning the fancy of our company.\n\nThe approval of others becomes a top social priority and dictates many of our actions. At some point or another, most of us succumb to this tendency to butter the rest of mankind’s bread, which is fine. It’s natural to do so. But, we must exercise caution. You see, investing ourselves too fully into how others perceive us can have terrible consequences.\n\n## __When We Care Too Much About Others’ Opinions of Us__\n\nPeople who frequently seek the attention and praise of others are looking for an external validation of themselves. They want something outside of them to deem them worthy, able, and good. Usually, this is because, at their core, they are filled with self-doubt. So they do what they can to increase positive feedback and eliminate negative feedback.\n\n> We pander to the whims of others, hoping to please everyone.\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more advice like this, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily messages from Shine. *</center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nBut here’s the problem with this way of thinking: When we act in such a way that eliminates negative criticism, we also eliminate many, many possible lifestyles, actions, and directions from our realm of possibility. We become slaves to that which we believe others will approve.\n\nThis is a tragedy! Within all of us, there are numerous things we really, deeply wish we could do — travel the Earth, start a business, build an Earthship, become a stand-up comic/vagabond, etc. etc. But the vast majority of us don’t do these things because we’re worried about what others will say or think. We end up sacrificing our selves and our dreams to try to appease those around us.\n\n![Osorio](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6G4AU6fnGMamIKaGw4kCGw/3f55b3954e3264a0ffdcbfe6dd31c34d/Osorio.jpg)\n\nFurthermore, it has been well-documented in psychological research studies (like [this one](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/92/3/641/) or [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21039486)) that social anxiety directly correlates to an exaggerated desire to increase validation from others and decrease criticism. This means that the more you care about how others will react to what you do, the more likely you are to be socially discontented and uncomfortable. Instead of suffering these consequences, we should adopt a different attitude.\n\n## __Let’s Embrace Those Who Judge, Scoff, and Speak Ill of Us__\n\nCaring too much about what others think of you stifles your ability to take risks and disrupts your social satisfaction. The funny thing is — whether we invest energy into making others like us or not, there will always be people who don’t. \n\nHistorically, many of the most loved people were also among the most hated while they were alive. Jesus Christ, Abraham Lincoln, and John Lennon were all assassinated for spreading messages of love and understanding. So, I’m suggesting that we’d all be much better off embracing those who will find reason to despise us.\n\nIt’s so much easier to do this than to waste our lives allowing the faultfinders to dictate our actions. Moreover, being disliked by people is actually a sign that you’re doing something worthwhile.\n\n## __Being Disliked Means You Stand for Something__\n\nWhen you simply mimic the values of your current company, your opinion stops being yours. You become a hypocritical piece of clay, molding yourself constantly to try to fit in everywhere, and in doing so, retaining no shape to call your own. \n\n\nConversely, being courageous enough to “do your thing”, stand by your values, and live your own lifestyle (even if it isn’t popular) is empowering because you develop a strong identity. Gradually, you become satisfied and confident in your own skin.\n\n## __Your Friends Will be True Friends__\n\nWhen your top priority is to gain the approval of everyone, you’re inviting people to befriend a sham. You’ve developed a façade disguising your complex, idiosyncratic, untidy self. Most people won’t know the you that’s buried beneath, and you may begin to forget that person too.\n\nOn the other hand, habitually [presenting your genuine, vulnerable, weird self](http://www.refinethemind.com/forge-meaningful-relationships/) does nothing but strengthen your acceptance of who you are. The people who call you friend will actually care about and believe in you, not some charlatan.\n\n## __How to Stop Caring So Much About Others’ Opinions__\n\nI may have convinced you that you shouldn’t care as much about what other people think, but perhaps you have no idea how to go about doing that. Here are a few tips.\n\n### 1. Stop Playing the Critic \n\nBefore you’ll be able to care less about others criticizing you, you must do your best to stop criticizing people. Realize that the act of judging others reflects your own intolerance. By rising above the behavior yourself, you can realize how juvenile it is in the first place.\n\n### 2. Take Minor Social Risks \n\nStart doing a few things that you normally wouldn’t do because of [your fear](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) of what others would think or say. Dance wildly at a show, voluntarily speak up in class, wear something edgy. Doing little things such as these will help you to understand that disregarding your fear of judgment and rejection is liberating! Others may have given you a harsh glance or whispered haughtily to a friend, but it was okay. You’re okay, and you did it. Your fears may never entirely cease, but you will learn that acting in spite of them was more important. The more social risks you take, the less you will care. That’s the God-honest truth. \n\n> As Kanye West once sang, “Everything I’m not made me everything I am.”\n\n\n### 3. Live by Your Deeper Values\n\nDo you know what you stand for? If you’re still discovering the answer to this question, that’s okay. However, from a young age, we all develop some form of a conscience. We inherently sense what paths are right and wrong for us. Start saying what you really feel and doing what you sense is right for you. We can develop a deeply rooted self-esteem by diligently upholding the values that most deeply resonate with us. The more you seek to align your actions with what you feel in the heart of your being, the less you will invest in the opinions of the mud-flingers.\n\n### 4. Focus on Actual Outcomes\n\nIf you’re feeling anxious or afraid of someone who may be directing condescending energy toward you, ask yourself: What is the worst thing that can come of this person’s distaste? What am I really afraid of? Usually, it’s nothing more than a bruised ego. In some cases (such as bullying, harassment, etc.), more severe damage can be inflicted, and action must be taken, but most of the time, we’re just afraid — afraid of not being the best, the smartest, the prettiest, the fastest, etc. It’s okay to not be these things.\n\n### 5. Love Your Good and Bad\n\nGive yourself permission to not be the things you wish you could be. Embrace the fact that all of your qualities — both your boons and shortcomings — are essential to the equation that is you. As [Kanye West once sang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO_IwoMxWPA), “Everything I’m not made me everything I am.” Insults damage us most when we define ourselves based upon our perceived flaws. Take time now and then to number the ways in which you’re halfway swell, and embrace the not-so-swell too. Or, perhaps look into the idea that ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are cultural or psychological constructions. They may not exist; we frame the world within the good-and-bad dichotomy because our minds naturally process things in terms of what they are not.\n\n__One Word of Caution\n__Sometimes, people who dislike you have legitimate reason to do so. Being genuinely yourself doesn’t do much good if you are genuinely an ignorant prick who refuses to change anything. Don’t forget to keep an open mind to constructive criticism and realize you still have plenty of shit to learn.\n\n__What Will This Mean for You?\n__This can mean about as much or as little for your life as you like. The message boils down to this: Your top priorities should be saying what you feel, and doing what flows organically from you (and c’mon, hopefully helping others here and there).\n\nIf you do this, more people may end up disliking you, but you will likely be more content, stand for something (not fascism, please), and derive a sense of meaning from your identity that is arguably hella valuable.\n\n“Don’t pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in inches.” ― Andy Warhol\n\n“I pay no attention whatever to anybody’s praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings.” ― Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\n*This article originally appeared on [Refine the Mind.](http://www.refinethemind.com/not-being-well-liked-by-everyone/)*\n\n[READ NEXT: Your Self-Consciousness Is Killing Your Creativity](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/your-self-consciousness-is-killing-your-creativity/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-03-07T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Jordan Bates","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.refinethemind.com/author/lostboyevsky/\">Jordan Bates</a> is a writer and perpetually curious autodidact interested in just about everything.

It’s easy to understand why they see happiness as something to celebrate: Happy people are healthier; they get sick less often and live longer. Happy people are more likely to get married and have fulfilling marriages, and they have more friends. They make more money and are more productive at work. Based on decades of research, it has become clear that happiness is not just a personal issue; it’s a matter of public health, global economics, and national well-being. \n\n> But focusing on all the negatives isn’t the surest route to feeling better. Instead, a simple way to start cultivating happiness is by recognizing the good.\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more tips to boost your happiness, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily text messages from Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\nBut it doesn’t come easy, as most of us know. Disappointments and annoyances grab our attention like gnats, and even the good things in life seem to lose their luster over time. Add to that a crammed schedule and mounting obligations, and happiness might just seem out of reach—achievable for other people, perhaps, but not us.\nFortunately, research suggests that happiness is something we can cultivate with practice. The Greater Good Science Center has collected many happiness practices on our website Greater Good in Action, alongside other research-based exercises for fostering kindness, connection, and resilience. Below are 11 of those happiness practices, grouped into five broader strategies for a more fulfilling life.\n\n## 1. Acknowledge the good\n\nIf we don’t feel happy, it’s tempting to look for things to fix: the job that isn’t prestigious enough, the apartment that’s too cramped, our partner’s annoying habit. But focusing on all the negatives isn’t the surest route to feeling better. Instead, a simple way to start cultivating happiness is by recognizing the good.\n\nIn the Three Good Things exercise, for example, you [keep a journal](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) devoted solely to the positives in your life. Each evening, you write down three things that went well and add some detail about each, including how they made you feel. For example, you might recall a heartfelt thank you from a coworker, a quiet moment drinking tea, or your daughter’s infectious laughter. Importantly, you also briefly explain why you think each good thing happened—which focuses your attention on the enduring sources of goodness that surround you.\n\nA 2005 study invited participants to do this practice daily for a week, and afterward they reported feeling happier and less depressed than when they started. In fact, they maintained their happiness boost six months later, illustrating how impactful it can be to focus on the good things in life.\n\n> Making a conscious effort to notice and explicitly acknowledge the various sources of joy around us can make us happier\n\nMany of those good things lie just outside our doorstep, and we can practice noticing them on a Savoring Walk. Here, you take a 20-minute walk and observe the sights, sounds, and smells you encounter—freshly cut grass, an epic skyscraper, a stranger’s smile. Each time you notice something positive, take the time to absorb it and think about why you enjoy it. On your subsequent Savoring Walks, strike out in different directions to seek new things to admire.\n\nIn a study by Fred Bryant of Loyola University Chicago, participants who took Savoring Walks daily for a week reported greater increases in happiness than participants who went for walks as usual. “Making a conscious effort to notice and explicitly acknowledge the various sources of joy around us can make us happier,” write Bryant and Joseph Veroff in the book Savoring.\n\nIf you have trouble seeing the good that’s already around you, another strategy is to create some. In Creating and Recalling Positive Events, you carve out time for yourself and fill your schedule with enjoyment.\n\nWhen you have a day free, don’t rush around doing chores; instead, try three different happy activities:\n\n__1 -__ Something you do alone, such as reading, listening to music, or meditating.\n\n__2 - __Something you do with others, such as going out for coffee, riding your bike, or watching a movie.\n\n__3 - __Something meaningful, such as volunteering, helping a neighbor in need, or calling a friend who’s struggling.\n\nIf your go-to happiness practice has been Netflix and a bowl of ice cream, this exercise can reconnect you with different sources of satisfaction. These three activities should offer you a sense of pleasure, engagement, and meaning, all viable paths to a satisfying life. A 2014 study found that even psychiatric patients with suicidal thoughts found value in doing this exercise, reporting more optimism and less hopelessness afterward.\n\n![Happy2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3878PgVIecSC8oMEsCo0Ok/e54e3c3f3ff3d431fe28014ead0449ee/shutterstock_144487549.jpg)\n\n## 2. Add happiness through subtraction\n\nEven after we identify the positives in our life, we’re still prone to adapting to them over time. A good thing repeated brings us less satisfaction, until it no longer seems to contribute to our day-to-day mood at all; we take it for granted. That’s why, sometimes, it’s a good idea to introduce a little deprivation. \n\nIn Mental Subtraction of Positive Events, you call to mind a certain positive event—the birth of a child, a career achievement, a special trip—and think of all the circumstances that made it possible. How could things have turned out differently? Just taking a moment to imagine this alternate reality creates a favorable comparison, where suddenly our life looks quite good. \n\nIn a 2008 study, participants who performed this exercise reported feeling more gratitude and other positive emotions than participants who simply thought about past positive events without imagining their absence. Mental Subtraction seems to jolt us into the insight that the good things in our lives aren’t inevitable; we are, in fact, very lucky.\n\nIf imagining absence isn’t quite enough for you, what about experiencing it for real? In the Give It Up practice, you spend a week abstaining from a pleasure in order to appreciate it more fully. This pleasure should be something that’s relatively abundant in your life, such as eating chocolate or watching TV. At the end of the week, when you can finally indulge, pay special attention to how it feels.\n\nIn a 2013 study, people who gave up chocolate savored it more and experienced a more positive mood when they finally ate it at the end of the week, compared with people who ate chocolate as usual. This exercise may not only open your eyes to a single pleasure (like the miracle of cacao), but make you more conscious of life’s many other pleasures, too.\n\n> Amid the chores and routines, life can sometimes feel dull and mundane. Reigniting our sense of meaning can remind us what’s important, which boosts our energy and gives us strength to face life’s stresses.\n\n## 3. Find meaning and purpose\n\nCreating and Recalling Positive Events reminds us that pleasure isn’t the only path to bliss; meaning can also bring us happiness, albeit a quieter and more reflective kind.\n\nIn the Meaningful Photos practice, you take pictures of things that are meaningful to you and reflect on them. Over the course of a week, look out for sources of meaning in your life—family members, favorite spots, childhood mementos—and capture about nine or ten different images of them. At the end of the week, spend an hour reflecting on them: What does each photo represent, and why is it meaningful to you? Jot down some of those thoughts if it’s helpful.\n\nAmid the chores and routines, life can sometimes feel dull and mundane. Reigniting our sense of meaning can remind us what’s important, which boosts our energy and gives us strength to face life’s stresses. In a 2013 study, college students who completed this exercise not only boosted their sense of meaning, but also reported greater positive emotions and life satisfaction as well.\n\nWe can also boost our energy and motivation by fostering a sense of purpose, and the Best Possible Self exercise is one way to do that. Here, you journal for 15 minutes about an ideal future in which everything is going as well as possible, from your family and personal life to your career and health.\n\nIn a 2006 study, participants who wrote about their Best Possible Selves daily for two weeks reported greater positive emotions afterward, and their mood continued increasing up to a month later if they kept up the practice.\n\nThis exercise allows us to [clarify our goals and priorities](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), painting a detailed picture of where we want to be. This picture should be ambitious but realistic so that it motivates us to make changes, rather than reminding us how imperfect and disappointing our lives are now. When we reflect on our future this way, we may feel more in control of our destiny.\n\n## 4. Use your strengths\n\nJust as we hunt for things to fix in life, we also tend to obsess over flaws in ourselves; our weaknesses loom large. But what if we put more time and attention into our strengths and positive attributes?\n\nThe Use Your Strengths exercise invites you to consider your strengths of character—from creativity and perseverance to kindness and humility—and put them into practice. Each day for a week, select a strength and make a plan to use it in a new and different way. You can repeat the same strength—directing your curiosity toward a work project one day and toward your partner’s interests the next—or work on different strengths each day. At the end of the week, synthesize the experience by writing about what you did, how it made you feel, and what you learned.\n\n> But decades of science also suggest that turning outward and connecting to the people around us is one of the surest routes to happiness.\n\nIn a 2005 study, participants who engaged in this exercise for a week reported feeling happier and less depressed, and that happiness boost lasted up to six months. Use Your Strengths may help us transfer skills between home and work—applying our professional creativity to our children’s school assignments or our domestic kindness to our co-workers—and give us a confidence boost all around.\n\n## 5. Connect with others\n\nThe practices above invite us to turn inward, tinkering with our attitudes and the way we view the world. But decades of science also suggest that turning outward and connecting to the people around us is one of the surest routes to happiness.\n\nAs a first step, you can try an adapted version of the Best Possible Self exercise for relationships to give you insights into what kinds of social connection you desire. In an ideal life, what would your relationships with your spouse, family, and friends look like?\n\nOne way to feel an immediate boost of connection is through Random Acts of Kindness. Random Acts of Kindness don’t have to be flashy or extravagant; they can be as simple as helping a friend with a chore or making breakfast for your partner. You can also extend your circle of kindness to strangers and community members, feeding a parking meter or offering a meal to someone in need.\n\nIn a 2005 study, participants who performed five acts of kindness on one day a week for six weeks reported increases in happiness. (This didn’t happen when they spread out their acts of kindness across the week, perhaps because a single kind act may not feel noteworthy on its own.) Researchers also suggest varying your acts of kindness over time to keep the practice fresh and dynamic.\n\nSome of your acts of kindness may involve giving, and the Make Giving Feel Good practice helps ensure that giving does, indeed, bring happiness. Researchers Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton, among others, have found evidence that being kind and generous does make us happier, but they’ve also found that acts of giving are most effective when they meet these three criteria:\n\nIt’s a choice: Give because you choose to, not because you feel pressured or obligated to.\n\nYou connect: Giving can be an opportunity to make connections with the people you’re helping, so choose activities where you get to spend time with recipients, like helping a friend move or volunteering at a soup kitchen.\n\nYou see the impact: If you’re donating money, for example, don’t just give and move on. Find out what your money will be used for—like new classroom supplies or a cooking stove.\n\nIn a 2011 study, participants were offered a $10 Starbucks gift card to use in different ways: They either gave it to someone, gave it to someone and joined them for a drink, or used it on themselves while drinking with a friend. The ones who gave the card away and spent time with the recipient—connecting with them and seeing the impact of giving—felt happiest afterward.\n\nOf course, the pursuit of happiness isn’t all sunshine and rainbows and mugs of tea and smiling children. Sometimes we need to tackle our insecurities and weaknesses, and we can’t just ignore our draining jobs and nagging relatives. But the practices here represent the other side of the coin, the one we often neglect: seeing, appreciating, and mobilizing the good.\n\n\n<center><a href=\"http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog\">![sign up](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6vW2d4wN3OI2YKmGOWweE6/730c1a952c9a9c90c3fd926d15d951f2/sign_up_for_Shine.png)</a></center>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"description":{"en-US":"These easy tips backed by science will help you increase your happiness. \n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Happiness","description":"Happiness","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3U7PCs0gXCuKEcWKUEM8q0/045374976c37982783a64701dda3a534/shutterstock_205692844.jpg","details":{"size":566991,"image":{"width":1000,"height":667}},"fileName":"shutterstock_205692844.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-03-06T13:00"},"tags":{"en-US":["happiness","science","advice","purpose"]},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"author":{"name":"Kira M.

But you also owe your partner that long overdue dinner date. To top it off, you promised mom you’d call her tonight to check in, you still have to finish laundry, and, oh shoot, you still have to buy a gift for your brother’s birthday this weekend. You think to yourself, “Well, it looks like Netflix and wine will have to wait.” Sound familiar?\n\n> While it may be impossible to get things right and please everyone 100% of time, creating a balanced lifestyle is key to living a wholesome life.\n\nLife is a rollercoaster of events. Some events are planned and others just show up uninvited on your doorstep right when you’re getting ready to unwind. Situations will and do occur to shake you up and distract you. You may begin to feel (if you’re not already) overwhelmed by responsibilities and the multiple hats you wear on any given day. While it may be impossible to get things right and please everyone 100% of time, creating a balanced lifestyle is key to living a wholesome life. Here are 5 tips on balancing life.\n\n> A positive attitude will help ease the pain of a challenge. <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/Dexai\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\n---\n<center> *For more tips to help you create balance in your life, [sign up for Shine.](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## 1. Attitude check\nIf you already got up on the wrong side of the bed, chances are you'll have a bad day. The Law of Attraction suggests that negative thoughts attract negative experiences and positive thoughts attract positive experiences. Ever have one of those days where one bad thing after another takes place? When you think about it, you were so focused on everything going wrong that you didn't have time to think about the things in life that were going right. Some situations are out of your control, but you do have the power to change your perspective. Begin to look at challenges as opportunities to develop yourself. A positive attitude will help ease the pain of a challenge. \n\n## 2. Plan ahead and prioritize \nIf you fail to plan, you plan to fail. It’s that simple! Planning ahead encourages you to say “yes” to the things that matter and “no” to the things that just aren't a priority right now. Go out and buy a fun planner. List out the things and people in your life that are most important to you (ex: marriage, family, health). Prioritize them and make intentional time first for those items in your calendar. Then [list out your to-do’s](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-best-ways-to-create-structure-in-your-day/s://) for the week. Prioritize them and decide what day and time you'll get them done. Don't wait to see what your day is looking like to decide if you’ll do groceries or go to the gym. Chances are you’ll be less productive and more stressed if you don’t plan ahead. \n\n> Mediate on the things you're grateful for, read a book, pray, write a reflective thought, take a long bath, or dance to your favorite\n>  song. <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/36d6c\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\n## 3. Take a break \n[Self care is essential](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/kristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) to productivity. According to The Energy Product research, “59% of workers are physically depleted, emotionally drained, mentally distracted, and lacking in meaning & purpose.” We aren't built to run on low fuel and if we do for too long, our bodies and minds will eventually give out. Listen to your body when it starts to tell you to [slow down](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/shine-squad-feature-ninas-4-tips-to-slow-down-and-enjoy-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). This means that from time to time you'll have to say “no” to things that knock on your door. You aren't a mean person for turning down an invite. You also aren't lazy for doing the laundry tomorrow instead of today. It's important to take time to relax and unwind. Mediate on the things you're grateful for, read a book, pray, [write a reflective thought](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), take a long bath, or dance to your favorite song. You deserve some quality time! \n\n## 4. Create a support system \nWhen life gets tough and chaotic, it's important to have a support system to keep you sane. Family, friends, and social groups are key to helping us make lemonade out of life’s lemons. My husband always tells me, “If you feel like you're battling alone, it's because you want to do it alone.” And he's right. Reach out to your close social circles and ask for help when you need it. You don't have to face challenges alone and oftentimes good company provides wisdom and sheds light on your situation. Going through life alone leads to [burnout](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), disengagement and resentment.\n\n> Life will continue to present daily challenges, but you can choose to face them with the right attitude and prioritize the people and things that are most important to you. <a href=\"hhttp://ctt.ec/890Ep\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n## 5. Find an accountability partner \nPeople who have accountability partners are more likely to follow through with their commitments. If we have managers at work to keep us accountable to deadlines, why wouldn’t we also have people in life that will keep us accountable to our personal goals? If you're trying to accomplish or maintain anything that's important to you, an accountability partner is key to keeping you on the right track. Some of us wouldn’t be where we are today without them! They check in to provide support where necessary and they aren't afraid to point out red flags when noted. Both parties need to be willing to be honest, open, and vulnerable, otherwise your accountability becomes faulty. Make sure you have someone in your circle that keeps you accountable! \n\nLife will continue to present daily challenges, but you can choose to face them with the right attitude and prioritize the people and things that are most important to you. From time to time, step away to relax and take a moment to refocus. When you’re feeling lost or need some encouragement, remember that your accountability partner and support system can help you stay on track. You’ll find that as you put these tips into daily practice, you’ll begin to live a wholesome life! \n\n__[READ NEXT: How to Delegate Successful (If You're Someone Who Hates Delegating)](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-delegate-successfully-if-youre-someone-who-hates-delegating/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)__\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>"},"title":{"en-US":"5 Simple Tips To Help Create Balance In Your Life"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-simple-tips-to-help-create-balance-in-your-life"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"description":{"en-US":"It can be hard to juggle it all.

The former is false, and the latter is very rare, if not impossible. The truth is: most successful young professionals have a \"mini advisory board\" that consists of [individuals from diverse backgrounds](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), offering a diverse set of expertise.\n\nI was part of mentoring programs as a kid, and those experiences led me to volunteer as a mentor for the last ten years, while offering consulting services to aid various mentoring efforts. I founded MentorMe, a cloud-based mentoring platform, because I saw an opportunity to leverage technology to automate and streamline previously onerous administrative tasks that come with running a mentoring program. Here are a few things to keep in mind when developing a relationship with a mentor.\n\n> Thoughtfulness goes a long way in mentoring relationships, and it's important for mentees to show interest in their mentor's professional accomplishments as well.\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more career advice, [sign up for Shine](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog).* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 1. Reach out to people outside your immediate network.\n\nThe way many people traditionally view mentorship is outdated. Thanks to technology, we're no longer confined to our immediate network. I strongly encourage people to take advantage of social media, conferences, and other networking events to[ find mentors outside of their company](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) or organization. Reach out with an introduction (a personal elevator pitch), a clear outline of your professional goals, and why you'd like to meet. Ask for a 30-minute video call or offer to take them out for coffee. Most people enjoy offering advice. It makes them feel good to give back. And you'd be surprised how many potentially great mentors have never been asked. \n\n## 2. Articulate the qualities you're looking for in a mentor and what your expectations of that individual are.\n\nThis could include personality traits, but also, how often you wish to communicate and what specific type of mentorship you’re seeking. Do you need coaching, networking introductions, professional advice? Figure out what makes the most sense for where you are in your career and be upfront about your expectations.\n\nHow often and by what means you connect depends on the individual. Some folks prefer email, while others like face-to-face interactions. It's important that both mentor and mentee communicate their preferences and establish expectations. I have mentors with whom I speak every few weeks, and others with whom I connect less frequently – that timeframe is based on our individual relationship, their availability, and the expectation we’ve outlined for our conversations. \n\n> Find ways to offer your skills and advice to someone coming up behind you while you continue to grow professionally. \n\n\n## 3. Accentuate the value you can bring to the relationship.\n\nIt's important that every communication is not a formal request for advice. Find out what common interests/hobbies you share with your mentor and try to find ways to connect with them by sending relevant links to interesting articles or books. Another way to stay connected is to keep up with their professional accomplishments and send them a \"congratulations\" email or card. Thoughtfulness goes a long way in mentoring relationships, and it's important for mentees to show interest in their mentor's professional accomplishments as well. Of course, if you do reach out to ask for advice, make sure you follow up on the outcome and thank your mentor for his or her time (a thank you card never hurts!).\n\nAnd as you move up in your career, don’t forget to give back. Mentoring others makes you a better person to mentor, because you understand both sides of the relationship. Find ways to offer your skills and advice to someone coming up behind you while you continue to grow professionally. \n\n\n[READ NEXT: Mind the Gap](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/mind-the-gap/)\n\n*This article originally appeared on [The Well](http://thewell.jopwell.com/?utm_source=shinetext&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shine).

When I made this song, there was a beautiful shift in my life. I fell in love, I decided to record my first Spanish album, I was filming my very first movie and living on my own for the very first time. A lot of firsts!

The kind of different that helped me grow and inspired me to [take control of my life](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) in a way that I hadn't before. \n\n> Love from the right places.

This story is about a young woman who isn't living her life for herself. Instead, she's going through the motions of life simply to please her parents and family. Although everything in her life is good. She's smart, hardworking, in a relationship with a good guy, she quickly learns that their idea of “picture perfect” isn't her kind of perfect. Deep down inside she knows something is missing... real love. \n\nEverything changes, as the song goes, when she meets someone who makes her feel different inside-- someone who inspires her, intrigues her, pushes her. Someone who gives her this sense of adventure, motivating her to break out of the mold and grow into a young adult who lives life by her own rules.\n\n## What changed for you for the better in the past year?\n__Becky:__ [There was] love from the right places. I stopped looking for it and instead it just came. Self-love. Family love. Real love.\n\n## What advice would you give to fans who are looking to make a positive change in their life?\n\n__Becky:__ You are who you surround yourself with. Cutting toxic-negative people from your life is a big step toward a new positive energy. Focus on making the relationships with good people in life stronger. Those are the ones you can count on. \n\n## What is one thing you do every day to help feel your best?\n\n__Becky:__ When you wake up in the morning and get ready for bed, take 5-10 minutes to meditate and give your brain a break. Focus on your breathing. Inhale the positive and exhale the negative. \n\n## What would you tell fans who are struggling with their confidence?\n\n__Becky:__ Self-love is the most important.

I’m just average.”\n\nYou find yourself wishing that you were there. __You cross your fingers and hope for that time machine to be invented, so you can be the person you’re meant to be - whoever the heck that is.__ This struggle is too much. The feedback you get on the work you do hurts. You’re supposed to be good at all this. The feedback hurts a little more when you take on this thinking.\n\nSome of your friends are living the life you wish you had. They’re going places you wish you could go, but you’re not. Success feels like a word only reserved for everyone else. You’re upset with yourself.\n \n## __Truth is: You’re not alone.__\n\nEver since I was a child, I’ve had people telling me that I’d be an influential leader one day. I was sure I’d grow up to be a pastor, teacher, or well-traveled person who touched lives. __I didn’t know how I’d get there, but that didn’t matter in my childhood mind.__ I had some real rough patches as a kid, and one day I decided that I’d take those hardships and use them to help others with their hard stuff. I was content with this thinking, I knew what my purpose was and what my impact could be, and I left it alone. \n\nI’m 29 now, and I feel like a failure on some days. I’m so thankful to be able to do things like write my [Sinclair.ity weekly emails](https://thesapronextdoor.com/sinclairity/) and I appreciate the ability to be able to share messages on social media. But, I get upset when I see others my age (and younger) blow right by me. How are they getting booked solid for gigs? How are they starting these amazing things that end up on the *TODAY Show* or *Ellen*? How is it that they seem to have their dream job already? What’s their secret?\n\nYou know what, that last questions has been tripping me up for far too long. And, I’m over it. I have a new focus and I’m going in a new direction. Now, I want to:\n\nSee who I am and what I can offer more clearly.\nAppreciate the impact I’m already having.\nIdentify the fears that are keeping me from stepping up my efforts.\n\n> You are already enough. \n\n[I'm exactly where I need to be.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/) Are you? \n\nI’m confident that you or someone you know is going through the exact same thing. It’s as if some unspoken charge was put out into the world for everyone to measure up, step up, and do more. That’s all well and good, but if you’re already doing the best you can, if you’re already trying to improve some parts of yourself, and if you’re showing up a little braver each day, it’s enough. That’s right it is enough. You are already enough. \n \nIt’s a myth that our efforts need to viral. You don’t have to create the next trillion dollar app, have your PhD, or be the CEO even the director. You don’t have to do it right now. You don’t ever have to do it.\n\n> You still matter. Right here. Right now.\n\nNow, if the time comes when you’re called to do it, that’s a different story. But, if that’s NOT where you are right now, there is so much richness and opportunity [right here where you are](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/). You could be working at the worst job in the world, and you still can be making something better or someone's life better. You could be surrounded by the meanest people in the world, and you could still hold fast to what you believe in and show up as who you truly are. You could have only five people who know about the good you are doing, and it still matters. __You still matter. Right here. Right now. __\n\nIt’s [hard for me to believe all this myself.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/mind-the-gap/) But it’s imperative that I do for the sake of hopefulness, gratitude, and every person in my immediate circle who is counting on me to be who I am. People are counting on you too. You might be aware who some of those people, and I guarantee that you have no idea of the other people who adore who you are and what you do. They could care less that you aren’t there yet. They are happy and supported just because of who you are and what you bring. \n\n## <center> [Join Sinclair in the Shine Squad](http://www.shinetext.com/squad?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) </center>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script> "},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Enough Today Header","description":"enough today","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4dVsAe6sso0CyWUaqsesCC/911c016d0f5a807aa38c4f7fb8956b6b/13920358_869585881572_2559845112060255017_o.jpg","details":{"size":116683,"image":{"width":1365,"height":1365}},"fileName":"13920358_869585881572_2559845112060255017_o.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Sinclair Ceasar","bio":"<p>Sinclair Ceasar is an Assistant Director of Student Life at Loyola University Maryland.

The demands, expectations and obligations feel like one giant to-do list life just bestowed on us.\n\n__It can feel like we’ve lost our free will. __\n\nThe [debate about free will](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-brain-work/201005/is-free-will-real-better-believe-it-even-if-its-not) has raged for centuries across philosophers, psychologists, religious academics and late night convos in cozy Brooklyn bars over vintage typewriters.\n\nWhether or not free will is ‘real,’ [research has shown](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550609351600) that when we believe we have more control and can exercise free will to our benefit, our performance at work, school, and other key parts of our lives improve.

You are a free agent to run this beautiful life of yours:\n\n## Take an Autonomy Audit\n\nRun inventory on the parts of your day that are already reinforcing your sense of control. Do you have a morning routine you love? A flexible dress code at your work? Reaffirm where you’re exerting control by hitting pause to reflect on the seemingly small, but important, facets of your day that prove it.\n\n## Reflect on an empowering moment of control \n\nAs humans with built in negativity-bias, we’re great at ruminating on the parts of our days where we feel we’re losing control or falling behind. But imagine you’re examining your life [from a third-party view](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/to-change-your-life-learn-how-to-trust-your-future-self.html). Reflect on a powerful moment you had where you made a choice that energized you. Broke off a toxic friendship? Took a trip that challenged you? Pay homage to the choices you’ve made along the way that have gotten you to where you are right now.\n\n## Switch up parts of your routine.\n\nAssert the control you possess over your day in small choices.

Find one meaningful way to set boundaries by saying no to something or someone that doesn’t uplift you (a coworker who’s distracting you, weekend plans you don’t feel up for). Reallocate that time to something that fuels you, like a passion project you just kicked off, a weekend bike ride, or cathartic ugly-crying to This is Us (speaking for a friend).\n\n## Switch to a language of privilege\n\nWhen we view what fills our day like obligations it weighs us down and we can be quick to forget that what seems like obligations are often the things we chose.  Make a powerful [change in your vocabulary](https://michaelhyatt.com/how-a-shift-in-your-vocabulary-can-instantly-change-your-attitude.html) by switching from a language of duty (“I have to go to work today”) to a language of privilege (“I get to do work I’m proud of every day”), better recognizing the opportunities that make up your life. \n\nWhile your day feels like everyone and everything is in the driver’s seat but you, never doubt that this life is yours to own.\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"title":{"en-US":"5 Ways Flexing Your Free Will Can Change Your Life"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-ways-flexing-your-free-will-can-change-your-life"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"shutterstock 383128441","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3tgAQXOOikI6WAuseisaSG/4878fec41bcb94ffd48f91e1b3ca2a98/shutterstock_383128441.jpg","details":{"size":15035539,"image":{"width":6639,"height":4171}},"fileName":"shutterstock_383128441.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-02-23T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Naomi Hirabayashi","bio":"<p>Naomi is the cofounder of Shine.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"Naomi","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3Fem90tEoo0mMamyQECwgm/4ad3932157a954a3525000bb6b22fa07/Naomi.jpg","details":{"size":43541,"image":{"width":775,"height":518}},"fileName":"Naomi.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["free will","control","big choice"]},"description":{"en-US":"How reminding yourself 'I've got the power!' can help you own your choices."},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"id":"27D00cSnjOO8gewGO2qY2q","urlPath":"articles/5-ways-flexing-your-free-will-can-change-your-life/"},{"title":{"en-US":"On This Day: 4 Ways Your #TBTs  Can Motivate Present-You"},"slug":{"en-US":"on-this-day-4-ways-your-past-can-motivate-present-you"},"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t’s 7:45 A.M., and I am squinting at my phone as I turn off my alarm. I instinctively open up Facebook’s push notification in a half-asleep daze to look back on the memories that I’ve apparently shared with 26 different people “On This Day.” Halfway through the scrolling, I cringe.\n\n“On This Day in 2010…”\n\n“On This Day in 2010 my friend and I took an completely awkward photo with a stranger who started talking to us on the bus so I could prove that I was having fun as a freshman in college.”\n\n__It terrifies me that on any given day I can stumble upon the Ghosts of Felicia’s Past__. \n\nIt’s like the virtual version of running into former high school classmates at Target while home for the holidays. These digital time-turning apps have made me run into my first love that broke my heart, friends I don’t talk to anymore, and a version of Felicia that didn’t fully understand herself. \n\nWhile there’s always something sentimental about naivete, the overwhelming [sense of insecurity](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/) I felt back then also creeps up. It’s a lot to feel, especially at 7:48 A.M.\n\nIn some instances, I get jealous of my past self. “Damn, 2010, 2012, AND 2014 Felicia was seizing the hell out of this day! Oh, but 2017 Felicia had a bad day at work. I’ll never amount to anything.” \n\nHow have these apps made me competitive with myself?! And is that a positive or destructive behavior?\n\n[Studies have shown](http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2015/0203-if-facebook-use-causes-envy-depression-could-follow/) that “feelings of envy can then lead to Facebook users experiencing symptoms of depression,” so how do we make these morning reflections of social media nostalgia pleasant and motivational? \n\nHere are four tips on how to use the days of yore to push towards a happy, successful, and fulfilling future:\n\n## 1. Write Out How It Makes You Feel\n\nIf these virtual look-backs have you feeling some type of way, it’s time to break out a journal, scratch paper, or even your phone’s notepad, and get ready to ask yourself (and answer) some questions. \n\n__What is your gut reaction to these memories?__ \n\nEmbarrassed? Vulnerable? Angry? Jealous? Sad? Identifying feelings can be tough because it may bring up emotions you’ve been trying to avoid, but writing down a list of the different emotions can help you break through barriers.\n\n__How does that make you feel? __\n\nAre you embarrassed because you accidentally sent a ‘reply all’ email at work? Are you vulnerable because you opened up in a relationship? Are you angry, jealous, and/or sad because your friends have been hitting their life goals and you feel like you’re still just treading the proverbial achievement-waters? \n\nWrite down your current emotions and compare to the list of memory-driven emotions. Note the similarities between the lists, because there may be patterns and habits you have developed. \n\n__What do you want?__ \n\nMaking a list of goals can feel lofty and overwhelming, so decide on your framing. Maybe you want to think big picture: what is the one BIG goal you’d like to achieve eventually, and work your way down to one goal [you can achieve in the next year](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/got-big-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-to-actually-reach-them/) that will help you get to the BIG goal, one goal you can achieve this month, and one goal you can achieve this week. \n\nAlternatively, you can start small -- creating basic habits that you can do each day and next thing you know, you’ve created a lifestyle change. Regardless of how you frame it for yourself, determine what you want.\n\n__What lessons from the past can use you in the present?__ \n\nNostalgia can sometimes help us identify what we crave in our current lives. Do you miss the community feel you used to have with your soccer team? Do you miss the English teacher that pushed you to create your best work? \n\n> All of the experiences you’re having now will help you get to where you want to go.\n\nThink about how you can apply that in your current life. Maybe you become the social chair of your office and plan happy hours for you and your colleagues. Maybe you ask your manager for more consistent feedback, or seek out a mentor. Looking to the past can help you build upon your foundation to achieve what makes you happy.\n\n## 2. Embrace Nostalgia and Reach Out to Old Friends\n\nIt’s okay to think back fondly on memories of your life -- recalling the pure excitement as you embrace future adventures, the pure fear as you stepped into the unknown. \n\nI often see my younger self taking full advantage of days of carefree bliss, before phrases like “student loans” and “apartment security deposit” were in my vocabulary. Moments like this can often leave you sentimental and longing for the past. Instead of a solo wallow sesh, reach out to the people that were surrounding and supporting you at that time. \n\n<center> ![TBT](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4fosMQgniEUCyKsUwSUYIU/a95d62490d21f401e405db8caa774357/Slack_for_iOS_Upload__14_.png) </center>\n\nAcknowledge the people that have seen you through everything: braces and pimples, your Lizzie McGuire phase, your bumper sticker decal obsession. They were most likely the ones that were there when you were building your dreams, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they were looking for support from their longtime friends too. \n\nWho knows, you might create even more memories.\n\n\n## 3. Take Note of Your Progress\nSifting through these memories, you may find yourself laughing at inside jokes in the making, smiling at dreams being formed, and head-shaking in that annoyingly all-knowing way at significant goals being achieved. \n\nYou have a new perspective. [Appreciate your growth](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/) by making a list of your accomplishments, because even if you feel like you’re stuck now, a visual list can remind you how far you’ve actually come and how many possibilities are in your future. Hope you still have that pen and paper out.\n\n__What goals have you achieved?\n__\n\nIf you’ve set goals for yourself in the past, this list will be fairly simple to produce. Did you achieve what you wanted to achieve? Finally got verified on Twitter? Became a council member for your town? Great! If you haven’t been an active goal-setter, think big picture about the life and habits you’ve imagined for yourself. \n\nWere you a small town gal with big city dreams, and now you’re thriving in the Big Apple? Did you hope that one day you would be able to spend weekends hiking with a backpack full of trail mix? Those count, too. \n\n__What fears have you overcome?\n__\n\n> Appreciate how far you’ve come and how many possibilities are in your future.\n\nThis does NOT mean you need to submerge yourself in a vat of cockroaches and reenact an episode of Fear Factor. Can you now give speeches when you used to feel like Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries? Have you publicly shared some of your creative work when the thought used to give you hives? You may not have developed specific goals around these fears, but it’s worth noting that you’ve spent time conquering ideas and notions that used to scare you.\n\n__What could you not have done a year ago that you are capable of now?\n__\n\nWhile this list could look similar to the lists above, ask yourself, what would I not have been able to do a year ago? This list may be filled with more unexpected and spontaneous achievements -- maybe it’s bench-pressing a certain amount of weight, or maybe belting a high C. What skills have you developed in the past year?\n\n## 4. Authentically Live in the Present\n\nMy friend Tyree Boyd-Pates has a signature phrase, “trust the process.” You can have an end goal or destination -- but don’t think that there is only one path to get there. \n\nYour journey may be winding as hell, have multiple forks with no munchkins guiding you, but everything you encounter along the way will only strengthen you. Don’t focus so much on the future that you can’t take in life lessons in the moment. \n\nAll of the experiences you’re having now will help you get to where you want to go, and perhaps more importantly, where you need to be. And that’s exciting, because I can only imagine what achievements will deserve an annoyingly all-knowing head shake in the years to come.\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-02-16T07:00"},"author":{"name":"Felicia Fitzpatrick","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://feliciafitzpatrick.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Felicia Fitzpatrick</a> is the Social Media Manager for Playbill.

Do you appreciate yourself? Are you devoted to yourself?\n\nIf not - it’s time to turn up the heat in the relationship that you’ll have until the end of the time: the one with yourself.\n\nHere are 3 ways to practice self-love this Valentine’s Day and everyday. \n\n\n## 1. Accept the you that you are today.\nWe often feel like we need to choose between bettering ourselves and accepting ourselves. \n\nNope.\n\nNot only can you accept yourself while striving to improve and thrive in your work and personal environments - it may be impossible to grow without a healthy sense of appreciation of where you are right now.\n\n[Research around self-compassion](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/got-big-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-to-actually-reach-them/) shows that a healthy sense of acceptance is one of the number one motivators to help us accomplish our goals. Think about it. If you’re beating yourself up already before even jumping into the things you want to work on, you’re not going to be too kind to yourself as you stumble along the way - and are likely to give up on your goals altogether.\n\nYour weight. Your hair. Your personality. Your laugh. Your kindness. Your dance moves. All of these things make up the you that you are right now. Own them. Fall in love with every piece of what makes you, you and learn to build on the beauty that already exists. \n\n\n## 2. Set Boundaries\n\n“Can I steal ya for a sec?” \n\n“Sure.” \n\nIf you find yourself saying this more times than you can count within a day, we need to talk. One of the most courageous acts of radical self-love is valuing your time, energy and how much of yourself you are giving to others. \n\nShow yourself you care by [setting boundaries that prioritize your own wellness](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/im-good-with-whatever-the-high-price-of-people-pleasing/). This does not mean that you can't still be kind, giving you. In fact, by adding parameters to your time and energy, you’re more likely to be more valuable to those that you want to support. \n\n> Set your own limits & clearly articulate them. It takes courage, but is also liberating & earns you new respect. \n\n\nIf your *sures* are piling up, get comfortable with firm no statements like, “let’s set up time to chat later, now’s not a good time” or “you know what? Tonight I just need some QT by myself on the couch. I’m going to hold on dinner out.”\n\nIn the words of Rosalind Brewer “set your own limits & clearly articulate them. It takes courage, but is also liberating & earns you new respect.\" \n\n\n## 3. Laugh With Yourself\n\nWe all know the old passive-aggressive saying “oh no, I’m not laughing at you - I’m laughing with you.” Mmhmm.\n\nThe good news is that this concept can be useful when it’s 1) true and 2) leveraged to deepen your self-love. The ability to have a sense of humor about our actions, our mistakes, our quirks is another form of expressing self-acceptance.  \n\nTry laughing with yourself about something that typically makes you feel inadequate. Next time you feel like a hot mess or unorganized, laugh at the idea that anyone realistically ‘has it all together’ (LOL). Feel like your body isn’t changing at the same pace of that motivational #fitspo account you follow on Instagram? Channel your inner-Beyonce and smile in appreciation of your curves. \n\n> Fall in love with every piece of what makes you.\n\n\nInstead of being self-deprecating, find a way to shrug off negative feelings with a smile and reflection of how you actually are pretty great.\n\n## Need more ideas for today?\n\nWe asked the Shine Squad ([more on that here](http://www.shinetext.com/squad)!) and here’s how they told us they’re practicing self-love this V-Day: \n\n-  I'm having Galentines w my girlfriends. We are making an Italian feast watching Cinderella and hanging out in our pjs all night while telling each other how awesome we are! - __Katie F.__\n\n-  Bought my hubby (and myself) access to Hans Zimmer's musical masterclass because we're trying to get back into playing piano. - __Jenna B.__\n\n-  I'm going to Hooters with friends because if you bring a photo of your ex, they shred it for you and give you 10 free wings and if getting yourself 10 free wings doesn't say self-love, then idk.  - __Diane Z.__\n\n-  Going to the gym to boost my endorphins and to feel strong! I also sent Valentine's Day cards to all of my gal pals expressing why I love having them in my tribe:) - __Morgan S.__\n\n-  Working from home! What better way to [work on my presence and joy] than to create some space for focus during my favorite time of the day? I'm hoping it will be productive, but most important, that it will lead to some more intentionality this week. -__ Lisa R.__\n\n-  Treating myself [with a] coffee, pedicure and blowout. - __Keri D.__\n\n-  I made rum cake. Just for me! (and will go to gym in morning. It's all about balance). - __Brooke D.__\n\n-  Getting 35 of my most fantastic and ferocious friends together for Galentines! Nothing says love like celebrating best-friendship. -__ Emily S.__\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"3 Ways to Fall In Love With Yourself On Valentine's Day"},"slug":{"en-US":"3-ways-to-fall-in-love-with-yourself-on-valentines-day"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"selflove","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4keBQuQEQMmOwicyEwQgae/3b7b066a6320d6c96ee2afa06056f0e0/selflove.jpeg","details":{"size":59058,"image":{"width":1200,"height":676}},"fileName":"selflove.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-02-14T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Marah Lidey","bio":"<p>Marah is the cofounder of Shine.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"MarahHeadshot2 (2)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5TpSe4dSxi0iieiYuwoemu/c0435b702e218b3d5ae7048851ecfb1a/MarahHeadshot2__2_.jpg","details":{"size":1467418,"image":{"width":2029,"height":1696}},"fileName":"MarahHeadshot2 (2).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["self-love","galentines","affection","gratitude "]},"description":{"en-US":"This Valentine's Day, get booed up.

Comedian, actress, and vlogger [__Grace Helbig__](https://www.youtube.com/user/graciehinabox) shared her 5 tips with Shine to help get your creative juices flowing. \n\n## 1. Feed your brain!\nMost times I find that when I feel most uninspired it's because I haven't been properly nourishing the largest muscle that contributes to my creativity: my mind. I haven't been allowing it to chow down on the movies, TV shows, music, comedy, travel, friends, etc. that it needs to understand original perspectives and draw new inspiration. So take a second and let your brain binge.\n\n## 2. Agenda! \nWhen I start to feel inspired my brain becomes a hurricane of half formed ideas and a hoarding ground of potential projects. To keep my creative flow going it's helpful for me to lay out an agenda, or some sort of [organized list of priorities.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-best-ways-to-create-structure-in-your-day/) It's entirely up to you on how you do this, there's no one way. I like to lay out every project idea I have in one long list and then go back and number how important each of them is to me in relation to the others. This helps me visually see which projects I should be spending more energy on and gives me some semblance of a time management plan. \n\n> Changing your environment's energy and adding new creative company can definitely help spark your ingenuity. <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/635tb\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n---\n\n<center> *[Sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for Shine for daily tips to help you live your best life.* </center> \n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Reward yourself! \nThis seems dumb, but I like to balance working hard with treating myself like a spoiled child. I think it's nice to create small goals or mile markers as you work that can allow you to pause and reward yourself for achieving. Rewards could be as small as pausing to watch an episode of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that you aren't caught up on yet, or as large as planning a happy hour date with friends at one of Lisa Vanderpump's restaurants. Treat yo self! \n\n## 4. Teamwork! \nIf you're feeling creatively cock-blocked by yourself, try co-working with a friend. Changing your environment's energy and [adding new creative company](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/your-self-consciousness-is-killing-your-creativity/) can definitely help spark your ingenuity. Just try to keep the primary focus on working before rewarding yourselves with double vodka sodas. \n\n## 5. Sleep! \nIf nothing seems to be working and the creative frustration keeps mounting, take a nap! Lay down and give your brain a break. Some say no rest for the weary, but I say... more rest to think clearly. Also, clearly I should take a nap. That phrase was extremely below average.  \n\nAnd those are my five tips to help spark your creativity. If you ever can't remember one of these tips there's a helpful acronym built in: F.A.R.T.S. Feed your brain, Agenda, Reward yourself, Teamwork, Sleep. Just remember those FARTS and you'll dominate those creative arts. Yep, I really should take a nap. \n\n---\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://ctt.ec/LixcP\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet\"></a> [Tweet](http://ctt.ec/LixcP) at Grace and tell her how you're being creative!\n\n\n\n\n__[READ NEXT: Kristen Bell's 5 Tips for Self-Care in 2017](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/kristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care/)__\n\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2017-02-09T12:00"},"author":{"name":"Grace Helbig","bio":"<p>Grace Helbig is a comedian, actress and video vlogger.

These two little letters can mark us with rejection, failure, disappointment, and confusion.\n\nWhether it’s a date, a job, a proposal, or an audition, here are a few helpful tips for dealing with the big N-O. \n\n> Choose to be gracious and kind, and you will be remembered for it.\n\n## Make a classy exit.\nSay “Thank you” and be appreciative of someone else giving their time to hear you. It’s okay to ask a few questions about why he or she came to their decision or what you can do to improve for the future, but yelling, lashing out, or outlining all the reasons why they are making a terrible mistake is not going to help anyone — especially you.\n\nChoose to be gracious and kind, and you will be remembered for it.\n\n## Give yourself a moment.\nThe last time I was turned down for a job I cried like a baby. I was sitting in my car in the middle of LA traffic doing the ugly cry. As childish as I felt, I knew I needed to let out the tension. I had poured my heart into the application process, meshed well with the team members I had met, carried very high hopes, and felt like things were going in my favor. My nerves were frazzled by the end of the two-week interview process, and a good cry was what I needed in order to let go. It’s okay to be disappointed and it’s okay to [acknowledge your feelings](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-things-to-tell-yourself-in-tough-moments/).\n\n## Realize it happens to everyone.\nMichael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper company because “he lacked imagination and had no good ideas.” Oprah was once fired from a television job because she was considered “unfit for TV.”\n\nEvery single person — even the highly successful ones — has been turned down at some point in their journey. You’re in great company.\n\n## Put in some time.\nTake a few hours or set aside a day to make some improvements. Go over any and all feedback you received. Update your resume. Amp up your cover letter. Ask [some trusted colleagues](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/) for their input.\n\nMy husband’s Jiu-Jitsu instructor often says, “You don’t get better by winning, you get better by losing.” There are always areas for improvement, and we often find them in the midst of rejection. Take the feedback and the critiques and use them to your advantage!\n\n> And we can dream about the things still to come. Move on. Dream. Go get ‘em.\n\n## Dream about the future.\nThere are times when you have done it all — you prepared, you rehearsed, you did the research, you have the skills, you know the market — and still you’re turned away. Sometimes there is no explanation. When these moments come and there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason, I tell myself that I am being protected from something. This thing I was running after must not be the best path for my life, and something better and more fitting must be coming up ahead.\n\nKnowing this, we can find rest and peace in rejection because it protects us from less than the best. And we can dream about the things still to come. Move on. Dream. Go get ‘em.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on Darling Magazine, by Janelle Whitaker.\n\n[READ NEXT: 4 Ways to Coach Yourself Through the Tough Stuff](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-things-to-tell-yourself-in-tough-moments/) \n\n*<font color=\"#D3D3D3\">Photo credit: bikeriderlondon/Shutterstock.com </font>*\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Create and Cultivate ","bio":"<p>Create &amp; Cultivate is a movement for women looking to create &amp; cultivate the career of their dreams. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"create cultivate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1bTeT49xZOEyusq6cU40kO/447ed90d92c9d0c36bedcebc4cddef30/cc.jpeg","details":{"size":8039,"image":{"width":271,"height":186}},"fileName":"cc.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Work"},"description":{"en-US":"Create and Cultivate explores how to overcome rejection and find peace by looking towards the future and what is to come."},"tags":{"en-US":["rejection","advice","improvement","no"]},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"headerPhoto":{"title":"surviving a no","description":"surviving a no","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1pP1iU4RisqaECeceqUAmW/371d9cd9e0676bb5d8ed8208b2f220b1/surviving_a_no.jpg","details":{"size":197142,"image":{"width":1000,"height":402}},"fileName":"surviving a no.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2017-02-08T11:00"},"id":"4vM9q9boNi8I4MSK6IMkqK","urlPath":"articles/the-5-steps-to-surviving-a-no/"},{"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">H</span>aving a free day to do anything one pleases.\n\nI know, it’s downright terrifying.\n \nFor your average [overly scheduled, impossibly busy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-sober-up-from-your-busy-ness-addiction/), eating-lunch-at-desk multi-tasker, the idea of having an entire day without an agenda or meeting can be bewildering. Being time-starved is a perpetual, borderline addictive state that many modern people have adopted as a lifestyle. Still, it’s neither healthy or sustainable, even for the most ambitious!\n\n[As I deliberated over taking a life break](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/taking-a-life-break-to-get-unstuck/), one of my greatest concerns was how restless I would be in a smaller, [slower](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/shine-squad-feature-ninas-4-tips-to-slow-down-and-enjoy-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) city where I knew only a few people and had no clear roles or responsibilities. No structure. I recalled how every exotic beach holiday was wasted as I, try as I might, couldn’t just lay out on a beach towel and relax. What would I do for an entire month without any quantifiable objectives for each day? Without some kind of schedule? Without meetings or even social drinks, coffees and dinners to fill up my time? I pictured long lonely walks in the rain as people haggled me to buy tourist chotchkies.\n\nI was so wrong. \n\n![Unstructured Day](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5ygBAMMC3eUiaQKsCcSwG2/c6f3e233c5af88859aaba20ea9bd672f/unstructured_day_body.jpg)\n\n---\n<center> *[Sign up](http://shinetext.com) for daily advice to help you live your best life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nHuman beings are amazing at creating order, even if there is none. Over the course of a few days during my break, a routine started to emerge. I would get up, get dressed, drink my hot lemon water and down a battery of vitamins, whip up a quick breakfast, then spend some time in solitude windowside as I thought, read and wrote. Then I’d hop over to my favorite neighborhood café to read some more. \n\nThe rest of the day was an equal mixture of spontaneity and structure. I was fortunate enough to have friends and even made new connections early on, so I had at least one planned engagement daily. Everything was up to chance and whim – if it was raining that day, I might check out a museum. If it was sunny, I might get to a pretty outlook near a canal or garden to picnic and read. \n\nI also had plenty of time to walk around alone but found it not as harrowing as my extrovert self had imagined; I felt like a kid discovering an unknown path home as I explored the city’s streets and neighborhoods. If I made a new friend that day, I’d often ask them to join me on my impromptu itinerary or would tag along to whatever fun activity they had on the books.\n\n\n> A day without an extensive to-do list can actually be a boost for any self-professing overachiever.\n\n\nThat said, I hope to incorporate into my life post-break some tips and benefits I have learned from these unstructured days, including:  \n\n## Have half an hour in the morning where you can just be quiet. \nWhether that’s to eat a nice breakfast, read or anything else that brings a sense of peace, using solitude to start off your day is powerful for your mental health and will impact your life positively.\n\n## Block off one night/afternoon/morning during the week to dedicate to whatever you want to do. \nBonus points if you spend time on your own to care for yourself and cultivate areas of greatest interest to you.\n\n## The next time you go out with a friend, leave the plans in their hands. \nOr you can take the reins and see if your friend is up for an excursion that you design off the cuff.\n\n## Switch up your lunch routine. \nDecide where you go to eat and who you go with at the last minute (so, maybe 10 minutes before lunchtime). \n\n## Assign at least one day every month to a new, undefined exploration of your city or anywhere else for that matter. \nNo pre-work required; just use a map app on your phone and go already!\n\t\nIf you need any further convincing, please note this: a day without an extensive to-do list can actually be a boost for any self-professing overachiever. Allison Gabriel, an assistant professor of management at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies job demands and employee motivation, [says that “the brain is like a muscle.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237446) You can strengthen it or deplete it. If you let this muscle recharge and replenish, you'll feel better mentally and see improvements in your [work] performance.”\n\nSo, there you have it. Your mental health will improve, your general performance in work (and life) will be enhanced. Plus, your capacity for possibility – whether that’s a new adventure for that day or for this season – will expand ten-fold. How does that sound for a new perspective?\n\n\n[READ NEXT: How a \"Life Break\" Can Get You Unstuck](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/taking-a-life-break-to-get-unstuck/)\n\n*<font color =\"#808080\">(Photo credit: dotshock/shutterstock.com)</font>*\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Ji Son Choi","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jschoi\">Ji Son Choi </a>is a creative strategist who collaborates with brands to bring their values and stories to life via custom content and technology.

Giving up control is never easy, and entrepreneurs in particular have a reputation for trying to do everything, all at once, all by themselves. But running a business alone is a little bit like performing every circus act by yourself–sometimes for the short-term, but hugely exhausting and challenging over the long-term. What’s more, bringing others onto your team can actually be beneficial for growth. If you cringe at the thought of delegating, here are some ways to move past that feeling.\n\n> The pursuit of perfectionism is a double-edged sword that makes it hard for people to surrender control even when they’re overwhelmed.\n\n\n## 1. Get honest with yourself.\nThink about why you hate the thought of passing responsibility off to others. Is it due to your perfectionist nature, or have you been disappointed by team members in the past? Maybe you simply don’t have time to find the right people and train them. For most people who choose to do it all, it’s a combination of all three reasons. The pursuit of perfectionism is a double-edged sword that makes it hard for people to surrender control even when they’re overwhelmed. \n\nPast bad experiences or disappointments can leave a bad taste in your mouth, reinforcing the belief that you need to[ manage everything](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/), big and small. And not having time to find your team is a byproduct of trying to do it all. My advice? Give yourself permission to take a chance. You have to say “yes” to the possibility it could all work out before you can decide it’s not for you.\n\n## 2. Find people who understand you and your business.\nThere is a whole wide world of qualified, awesome job-seekers out there, but not all of them will be a good fit for you and your business. If you’re an entrepreneur, chances are that you know a few other entrepreneurs that can refer you to consultants or professionals that they admire and trust. \n\nIf not, reach out to close friends or family and see if they know any capable people in your desired industry. One of the great benefits of technology is that people often reach out on social networks when they’re looking for a job or consulting opportunity. While you may not have time for a lengthy application process for prospective consultants or employees, you should design a way to gauge whether they are a good fit. \n\nA phone or video call can help you assess whether you have similar communication styles. Ask about working styles, schedules, and who an ideal client is for them. Explain your own long-term and short-term goals. Let it unfold as a conversation and understand that not everyone will be a fit. If it’s not, move on! \n\n>  As you make for time for yourself, you’ll have more freedom to pursue new clients and work on long-term projects or goals.\n\n## 3. Start small.\nYou don’t need to hand off a huge component of your business all at once. Chances are that some occasional help with specific tasks will help you focus your energy and time. As you get more comfortable delegating, you can identify areas that don’t need your everyday input and begin to gradually lighten your load even more. \n\nAs you make for time for yourself, you’ll have more freedom to pursue new clients and work on long-term projects or goals. You’ll also be able to keep to a less grueling schedule. Rather than working around-the-clock, you’ll be able to [work smarter](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-best-ways-to-create-structure-in-your-day/), and you’ll be more likely to leave work behind when you’re done for the day. \n\n![How to delegate body](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/21xrVynex64SE6KsYykgeo/3ea1ac929c2c26b4c7e8878e7cc63d73/shutterstock_569182933.jpg)\n\n---\n<center> *For more advice to learn to delegate, [sign up for Shine.](http://shinetext.com)* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 4. Let technology help you.\nDelegating can be a logistical challenge if you’ve been working solo for months, or even years. If you haven’t had a reason to share your files with anyone else, chances are that everything is on your laptop within a system that only makes sense to you. Before you even begin to hand over tasks, get organized. \n\nSetting up a mechanism for the smooth transfer of information will save you hours down the road. Regardless of how organized you are, remember that new hires don’t know what you know and can only assimilate the information that you give them. Make it easy on both of you by setting up a Google Drive or Dropbox with important files and instructions. Quick, written tutorials on how you ordinarily complete tasks can be used as references, resulting in fewer questions for you along the way. While you have to expect a lot of questions in the beginning, streamlined resources will make the transition ten times quicker.\n\n> Being an entrepreneur is thrilling, but it can also be lonely at times.\n\n## 5. Capitalize on the creativity of your team.\nWorking alongside others means that you have greater opportunities to brainstorm new ideas. This doesn’t mean that you have to give up your solopreneur status; there will still be projects and initiatives that you want to tackle alone. When you want to bounce ideas off of someone else, however, your consultants, employees, or team members will be ready and able to help. \n\nGiven their familiarity with your business, they also may have some great ideas of their own. Being an entrepreneur is thrilling, but it can also be lonely at times. On days when you feel like you’re in a rut, you’ll be grateful to have the ear of someone who understands how to help your business thrive, and who can help implement whatever next big thing you can dream up. \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Life Hacks For the Overcommited\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-tips-for-the-overcommitted/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"How to Delegate Header","description":"How to delegate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6I1Iv3ACtiQk6KAsgmwyMc/83999e276406e637803d85ddadd9f464/How_to_Delegate.jpg","details":{"size":279909,"image":{"width":1000,"height":482}},"fileName":"How to Delegate.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Harper Spero","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.harperspero.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harper Spero</a> is a New York City based business and career transition coach who has found a way to integrate passion with purpose.

Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life, but define yourself.”― Harvey Fierstein\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">S</span>elf-consciousness is the enemy of all creative expressions. The human race’s creative power is distributed in all of us, not concentrated in selected few. \n\nEvery object or product you know today, however old or new, however simple or sophisticated, holds the stories of thousands of people who were bold enough to share with the rest of us. And courageous enough to launch no matter their imperfections.\n\nCreation is a process and it gets better with time and iteration. The most creative among us have mastered their crafts. They have developed their skills over a long period of time to be better and remarkable at what they do.\n\nYou can be as creative as you want if you allow yourself enough time, focus and commitment to master what drives you or makes you come alive. Unfortunately many people have chosen to deny us their gifts because they [lack confidence and are too critical of themselves.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/) They can’t help but worry about everything wrong with what they intend to launch, start, do or create.\n\n![creativity](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5WQWOZJPFemYOygK2Ak2Cg/77a7314538e57e1be0cc76bc7e2735a8/jwimshwif14-jeff-sheldon.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more advice to improve your creativity, [sign up for Shine.](http://shinetext.com)* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\nThey can’t express themselves because of self-consciousness and the fear of how things will turn out. They have placed limitations on what they can do and have therefore chosen to lead mediocre lives. Life without fulfillment and meaning. “You’re always with yourself, so you might as well enjoy the company.” says Diane Von Furstenberg.\n\n> “As long as you look for someone else to validate who you are by seeking their approval, you are setting yourself up for disaster. You have to be whole and complete in yourself. No one can give you that. You have to know who you are — what others say is irrelevant.”― Nic Sheff\n\nThe best gift you can share with your audience, no matter how small is your authentic self. Your imperfection is the source of your character and creative powers. It’s who you are, the best parts, not perfect, not trying — just yourself. And you should be proud and bold enough to express yourself [without fear of failure](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/) or being criticised.\n\n\n## Failure is only a form of feedback.\n\nThe moment you begin to worry about the worth of your creative expression and how it will be received it becomes stilted, forced, and fake. Self-consciousness kills the magic in any form of creative expression and it gets worse with time if you don’t do something about it. Mark Twain once said “The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself.”\n\n## Create for yourself first!\n\nYou should be your number one fan. Do whatever you need to do even if you think others won’t like it. That frees you from the desire to please your audience and everyone else who will see your work. You will create something original, unique to you and honest enough to share with your audience. Ignore those judgmental voices hissing and whispering over your shoulder.\n\n> “Why should we worry about what others think of us, do we have more confidence in their opinions than we do our own?”― Brigham Young\n\nYou don’t have to be right when you start any creative project. The only thing that matters is that you show up everyday and just do what matters to you. For every piece of creative product you have seen, there are thousands of false starts and questions. You can only become comfortable and trust your work if you focus on getting it done, launching it and improving it with time. Practice can’t make you any worse! It can only make you better.\n\n![creative](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5kAygiCTVSA2KuEycAoa6a/a954dafacbd2e0a13e26f205a5863377/6mq_l_txzo4-brooke-lark.jpg)\n\nSee your first creative work as an experiment. Deliberately do things in a way that keep you from thinking about how people will react to it when it’s done. Stephen King wrote about writing his first draft with the door closed (metaphorically) and later drafts with it open. \n\nYou want to bring up whatever’s inside you and in a way that encourages it to come out instead of entertaining thoughts that limit what you can do. Give yourself the freedom to create.\n\n## Separate ‘creating’ and ‘analysing’\n\nBoth aspects of the creative process are extremely useful but different. Don’t analyse everything you do as you create. Just concentrate on finishing your first iteration without worrying about the quality or final product. You can always come back to it.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci is believed to have worked on the famous Mona Lisa painting between 1503 and 1517. ‘You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great’ says Zig Ziglar. The goal is to keep moving forward once you start. Unlike Leonardo, you may have to show your work to get feedback and improve. But where necessary seek feedback to improve as you create. \n\nTrying and failing is better than never trying at all.\n\nThis article originally appeared on [Inc](http://www.inc.com/thomas-oppong/your-self-consciousness-is-killing-your-creativity-and-what-to-do-about-it.html).\n\n[READ NEXT: How To Stop Comparing Yourself to Others and Start Thriving](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-stop-comparing-yourself-to-others-and-start-thriving/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Thomas Oppong","bio":"<p>Founder @Alltopstartups.

These new ways to connect can bring us closer and make life easier, but also it causes us to forget to connect in person from time to time. It’s important to take time out of your busy day to remember to be present and find those little moments of joy in the mundane. \n\nHere are my five simple ways to remind yourself to be present and joyful every day.\n\n## 1. Try Something New. \nYou never know what could bring you joy if you never try! The rush of something new can be exciting and forces you to break your everyday pattern. It can be something simple like trying a new coffee shop in the morning or something bigger like [playing a new sport.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/) It helps you grow as a person to put yourself out there. \n\n## 2. Phone a Friend.\nPick someone at random from your contacts list. It could be someone you talked to yesterday or someone you haven't spoken to for years. Give them a ring! Don't text, actually pick up the phone and call them. Have a real, present conversation. Ask them about their day, their life, and their favorite things! Reconnecting with another human you care about is one of the best feelings.\n\n> Take a moment of quiet for yourself on occasion. <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/T7BYd\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n\n## 3. Take Yourself on a Date. \nTake [a moment of quiet for yourself](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/) on occasion. Go to the park, have a picnic, read a book, go to your favorite restaurant, go see a movie, go for a run, do something that makes YOU happy. Simply taking time to reflect by yourself doing an activity you love can allow you the space to clear your head and reconnect with yourself.\n\n## 4. Talk to Strangers. \nI know, I know… this is technically not what you're supposed to do BUT - it’s not what you're thinking. All I'm saying is put yourself out there sometimes. Say “hi” to someone walking by, tell someone you like their shoes, their smile, or their scarf, strike up a conversation with your waiter or the cashier or the person in line behind you! In doing so, you will probably make that person’s day, and your own in the process.\n\n![More present](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/339wq63js4UwASsymiKc88/ffbc248405674a6f9455a14b6569fab3/BeMorePresentHeader.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center> *For more tips to help you be present and joyful, [sign up for Shine.](http://www.shinetext.com)* </center>\n\n---\n\n## 5. Celebrate You!\nIn all this connecting with other people, don't forget about yourself! Find something about yourself that you feel confident about. It could be your smile, your walk, your sense of style, your math skills, or anything you love about you! Think about that when you get up in the morning and do what you can to make that stand out. It will give you that extra boost of confidence and remind you that you are extra special.\n\nBy taking a moment every day to do even one of these five suggestions, you can remind yourself to appreciate those special little moments in life. Life is crazy - we all know that - but by being present and joyful with those around you and in those moments, you can really live.\n\n\n[READ NEXT: LOLO's 5 Tips to Embrace Your Inner Shine](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-tips-to-help-you-embrace-your-inner-shine/)\n\n\n<font color=\"#808080\"> \nPhotos credit: \nJeremiah Wilson <br>\npixelheadphoto digitalskillet/shutterstock.com </font> \n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Katherine McNamara header","description":"Katherine McNamara header","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5k5R12vZmwim0oaEmosEe2/96cc79187ed6676a6a474e0f26156698/KATHERINE_MCNAMARA_HEADER.jpg","details":{"size":3070845,"image":{"width":4684,"height":1956}},"fileName":"KATHERINE_MCNAMARA_HEADER.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"description":{"en-US":"Katherine McNamara, the star of Freeform's Shadowhunters, shares her tips to help you be more present and joyful."},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["Katherine McNamara","joy","tips","present"]},"author":{"name":"Katherine McNamara","bio":"<p>Missouri native Katherine McNamara is an up-and-coming young starlet who can currently be seen starring as the lead &#39;Clary Fray&#39; in the brand new Freeform series &quot;Shadowhunters;&quot; a book-to-screen adaptation of the bestselling &quot;The Mortal Instruments&quot; book series.

You may even feel angry and blindsided.\n\nThis quick experiment illustrates the __comparative nature of happiness__. Either way you still get the same car, yet you don’t feel as happy when you compare it to what your friends got.\n\n## Comparing yourself to others is in our DNA, so don’t beat yourself up!\n\n[Social comparison theory](http://psychology.about.com/od/sindex/g/Socialcomp.htm) states that we compare ourselves to others to make accurate evaluations of ourselves. We can thank evolution for this double-edged sword.\n\nCompared to most animals, we are [slow](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/shine-squad-feature-ninas-4-tips-to-slow-down-and-enjoy-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), hairless, defenseless creatures. As a caveman, my survival depended on making an accurate assessment of what other people were thinking. If I knew where I stood in the tribe, I knew how to behave to gain access to resources and not get killed.\n\nHowever, since our early ancestors grew up in bands of 50–200 people, our brains are hardwired to only keep track of about 150. Anything beyond that becomes part of the faceless mass known as “they.” “They” exist outside your [sphere of influence](http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html) so there’s no point in measuring up to them.\n\n## Comparison Overload\n\nFast forward to today, you still have the same nervous monkey brain, but there are zero boundaries for who or what you can come into contact with. You can creep for hours on Facebook gawking at people you’ve never met, seething envy when they have a better job/spouse/physique, sending you to bed in a worse mood without that person ever knowing you exist. \n\nThe irony is that people edit their online persona to look like their life is more exciting and full of joy than it actually is, so you end up comparing your behind-the-scenes internal monologue with their public highlight reel.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QxVZYiJKl1Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nEven if you stay off social media, we live in a global economy, so it’s easy to feel like it’s you against the world. If you’re studying at a university, you have to worry about competing with thousands of people in your major. Not only that, but everyone else in different majors who go to your school. Not only that, but everyone who goes to an equally reputable school. So if you’re in college, it’s you against hundreds of thousands of same-aged, equally intelligent peers.\n\n__But it gets much, much worse than that.\n__\n\n## Did you forget about the rest of the world’s most attractive, talented people?\n\nEvery day we are bombarded with images of the unattainable ideal. Gorgeous genetic anomalies are photographed with perfect lighting, photoshopped, and plastered on every advertisement and magazine cover. \n\nThese images make women feel like crap, and guys wish they had [hotter girlfriends](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/EHB2000a.pdf). The effect is the same in reverse for guys viewing photos of very powerful men. After a long day, you’re tired and already feel like you’re doing your best when you make eye contact with the Playboy centerfold or the powerful man on Men’s Health and think “if only I had that.”\n\n![shutterstock 504557311](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2sinkPtUyoWyy6EKiiyKo6/97795135c6f43b9aaa1cd04b6fe1a19e/shutterstock_504557311.jpg?w=700)\n\nThese people are the top 1% performers in their fields. They are basically unbeatable rivals. __To compare yourself to them is a losing game.__\n\nNow I’m not suggesting that you just play it safe and settle, but let’s say you work ass off and actually make it to the top — Good luck maintaining that level of success over time, especially with newer peers every day, nipping at your heels for a piece of the throne.\n\nIn small doses, comparison can light a fire under our ass to improve our lives, but in our hyper-connected world it’s more likely to cause __envy, distrust, anxiety and depression.__\n\nThis may be why [Forbes’ richest Americans have about the same level of happiness as the Amish](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2011/01/29/beyond-economic-treadmill-and-toward-true-well-being). The billionaires reached the impossible ideal, but the Amish are off the grid so that comparison isn’t even a part of their consciousness.\n\n__Luckily there’s a way to get out of the comparison trap without leaving your technology behind.\n__\nOk So what’s the solution?\n\n## 1. Be Grateful For What You Already Have\nIf you’re reading this, I’m guessing you have a home — with running water, and access to education, whether in school or online. Congratulations, [you are among the top 8% wealthiest people on Earth](http://posters-for-good.tumblr.com/image/542977597).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbrightside%2Fvideos%2F861895883939156%2F&show_text=0&width=400\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nPeople who [write down 3 things they are grateful for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal) every night are happier. By focusing on what you already have, you train your mind to come from a place of abundance.\n\n> “Happiness is not having what you want. It is wanting what you have.” — Anon\n\nOur imagination got us out of the caves, but it is the source of most modern unhappiness. Numerous studies demonstrate that we are notoriously [bad at predicting what will make us happier in the future](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy?language=en). Big life events like winning the lottery or getting in a bad car crash do have effects that can last years or longer, but not as big as you’d think. Life is full of ups and downs, and we generally adapt to them pretty quickly. The difference in overall quality of life depends on how we respond to each situation. \n\n![Journal1](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4DbefBCwZao0Gq6IkuAW48/04a69aebbc4479af8e42f9759ee1b088/journal1.jpg?w=700)\n\nWe have the choice to feel helpless and blame society/genetics/family for our problems and not even try. Or, we can view failure as another word for learning and continually grow each day. __(Pro tip: go with the second option)__.\n\nEvery time you find yourself thinking, “if I just get a good grade on this test/if I just get this girl/If I just make a six-figure salary, etc., I’ll be happy” — catch yourself, challenge it, and be present. Live in the moment; __you are right where you’re supposed to be.__\n\n## 2. Focus on Your Strengths\n\nAs cliché as it sounds it’s true: there is no one on Earth better at being you than you. We all have different strengths. Studies suggest that people who focus on cultivating their strengths are happier and more successful than people who focus on compensating for their weaknesses.\n\n> “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” — Anonymous\n\n\nDon’t get me wrong: you should aim to be a well-rounded person, but no flaw holds up as a valid excuse to live your life with a victim mentality. So don’t waste your precious time overcompensating to be like the person on TV. Instead, turn your signature strengths into a personal brand of awesomeness. Let your freak flag fly!\n\n## 3. Focus on Serving Others\n\nSo it’s clear that our overly social brain can be a curse, but it can also be a gift. You have [mirror neurons](http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror.aspx) that fire off the same way whether you watch an action or perform the action yourself. When you see someone in pain, you feel it on a gut level. When you connect with others and make them feel good, you feel good — __it’s a win/win situation.__\n\nIt’s easy to resort to judging and criticizing others to boost ourselves up and feel a short-lived sense of control. But by latching onto the need to label others, you limit your reality to a frail, inflexible frame. Remember the quote, “When you point at someone, there’s always three fingers pointing back at you.” When you hate on others to make yourself feel better, you’re really just hating on yourself. Focusing on others’ shortcomings is a shortcut to treating the symptoms of your own insecurity. \n\n![createherstock-inspire-create-3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/BlvlZn3YZiQ6i2y8QWuEg/65ca124e33267db371ca5feda2f5a140/createherstock-inspire-create-3.jpg?w=700)\n\nThe good news is, the inverse is also true: boosting others up, boosts your self worth. Be kind to others and try to appreciate their positive traits. This way you turn off your internal ranking system, and subconsciously start feeling more positive about yourself. They’re cool, you’re cool, and we are all figuring this out together. When you adopt this attitude, people can sense you’re coming from a non-judgmental place, and they’ll put their guard down. From there, an amazing self-fulfilling prophecy of positivity unfolds.\n\n> “Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.”—Buddha\n\n\n## 4. Enjoy the Journey Not the Destination\nThe egocentric survival instinct to amass as much material wealth at any cost is persuasive. We are culturally brainwashed to buy into the “if-then” model of happiness. We’re sold “magic pills” for weight-loss, relationships, and success. Apps are designed to be addictive; yummy warm dopamine fires off in your brain everytime you get a notification; Now more than ever, we expect instant gratification. We want the gold at the end of the rainbow and forget to take in all the colors along the way.\n\n> “The really happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery when on a detour.” — Unknown\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but someday you and everyone you know will die; and when you do, you won’t be able to take your possessions with you. Your time and energy are too precious to waste on impressing other people.

Embrace your current circumstances and embrace your self. \n\nWhen you conquer yourself, all those external pleasantries will follow, but they will simply be the cherry on top of your already delicious sundae.\n"},"title":{"en-US":"How To Stop Comparing Yourself to Others and Start Thriving"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-stop-comparing-yourself-to-others-and-start-thriving"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":"Four tips for embracing your authentic self."},"tags":{"en-US":["comparison","authenticity ","judgmental ","fomo"]},"date":{"en-US":"2017-01-31T08:00"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"shutterstock 201455762","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5dl6nk0dYQA4Ka4yscaWKw/19a06741ddca25e7de60490383606f09/shutterstock_201455762.jpg","details":{"size":7735326,"image":{"width":4250,"height":2833}},"fileName":"shutterstock_201455762.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"James Berges","bio":"<p>Psychology, language, and futurism nerd, writer of comedy, culture change, and self-development. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamesberges\">Follow James on Medium</a>.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"James B","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3BY1u7EgQoUMu22sQKq2AI/647ecec986c41120d00ef0864100ea63/jamesb.jpg","details":{"size":7772,"image":{"width":162,"height":162}},"fileName":"jamesb.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"facebook":"jamesberges"},"category":{"en-US":"life"},"id":"4gh8DjneKQagKcg0eCs8Qm","urlPath":"articles/how-to-stop-comparing-yourself-to-others-and-start-thriving/"},{"title":{"en-US":"LOLO's 5 Tips to Embrace Your Inner Shine"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-tips-to-help-you-embrace-your-inner-shine"},"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>e caught up with the Jackson, TN native LOLO around her single [“Shine”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9FcMIYatmI) (which she just performed on *The Bachelor*, nbd) and her tips to help others Shine. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9FcMIYatmI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## What inspired you to write the song “Shine?”\n\nShine is about discovering how strong you are by the things you’ve had to overcome. I’ve struggled with depression (among other things)  in the past and I reached a point where I had to decide what I wanted to do about it. Was I gonna sit around and let it continue to own me or was I going to put my big girl pants on and deal with my shit? I chose the latter and I’m so glad I did. \n\n> Go ahead and Shine.\n\n## What tips would you give people to encourage them to Shine?\n\n## 1. Be your own beautiful. \nWe each have [our own special routine](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-importance-of-a-daily-routine/) that helps make us feel comfortable in our own skin. Making time for these things will help you get in the right headspace to be able to take on whatever challenges come up, especially on the days when you can’t be bothered. \n\n## 2. Have a daily dance party. \nBefore I leave the house in the AM, I [have a dance party](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/) and let any anxiety take a hike. A few of my fave dancing tracks are “Freedom! ’90” by George Michael, “Never Be Like You” by Flume, “You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette, and “Shut Up & Dance” by WALK THE MOON.\n\n## 3. Don’t forget to breathe. \nThis may seem like a no-brainer, but we’re not always aware that we may not be breathing properly. Anxiety, stress and other similar factors can greatly affect our breathing. Taking a few minutes out of your day to find your breath and recenter helps keep the stress levels low.\n\n## 4. Eat what you love. \nWe’re all trying to ‘keep it tight’ these days. Healthy living and eating are a great practice but it can become mentally taxing if you’re constantly restricting yourself from your fave foods. Food is a very important and personal thing to each of us and life is really short…so eat the cookie. \n\n## 5. Put yourself first. \nWe spend most of our time [worrying about other people’s needs](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/im-good-with-whatever-the-high-price-of-people-pleasing/) and wants. Ultimately, you’re the only person who can know what you need, but if you’re not staying in tune with that it’s very easy to lose track. Be good to yourself.  \n\nGo ahead and Shine. <3 \n\n*Text LOLO to 75985 for a special message from LOLO and daily texts to help boost your confidence.*\n\n\n<br>\n\n[READ NEXT: Kristen Bell’s 5 Tips for Self-Care in 2017](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/kristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care/) \n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"LOLO","description":"LOLO headshot","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/GYeZb859i6mUiYMkQg0Gs/c9aef0a112bb4acdc2ad3d811dc5d136/LOLO.jpg","details":{"size":1093787,"image":{"width":2000,"height":889}},"fileName":"LOLO.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"LOLO","bio":"<p>From Jackson, TN, LOLO is a show-stopping singer who has &quot;so much music flowing through [her] that it fills two people&quot; (Associated Press).

I’d like a job in empathy.” said a student. \n\nThese are someone’s ideas…BIG ideas, ideas with potential. What if…?\nBut what often happens at the brink of invention when we’re discussing a new business venture, a creative endeavor, or an attempt to find better, more meaningful work?\n\nThe “challenge,” the “but”…some call it the “reality” check. I’ve seen this happen in two ways.\n\nFirst, we often thwart our own creativity because we question what’s possible too quickly in the process.\n\n> What could happen if we shift our approach to a new idea? Maybe nothing. Or maybe adventure ensues.\n\n\n*Combine work and empathy? But can I make any money? And will this be a struggle?*\n\nThis usually happens out of fear. It’s overwhelming to believe we can shift from idea to reality. What are all the steps involved?\n\nOther times, we’re simply discussing ideas with family, friends and co-workers and a game of devil’s advocate ensues usually in the spirit of discussion and sharing knowledge.\n\n*Oprah 2.0? But there’s only one Oprah, and that’s just impossible. How will you do it?*\n\n*A Christmas movie about an elf? But that already exists. How will you be different?\n*\n\nIt’s fun and necessary to engage in discussion and pose a challenge. This encourages us to look at an idea from a different perspective.\n\nHowever, I feel disappointed when I hear these conversations because the *“but”* immediately stifles innovation and creativity often leaving the person with the idea feeling like she has to defend herself or like there’s a flaw in her thinking.\n\nSo what could happen if we shift our approach when we have a new idea?\nMaybe nothing. Or maybe adventure ensues.\n\nNext time you have an idea, no matter how big or small, and whether it’s wanting to pursue work that incorporates empathy and kindness or you want to be the next Oprah, follow these four steps.\n\n## 1. Until Further Notice, Don’t Talk About It\n\nI know, I know. You have this great idea and you can’t wait to share it. You want feedback, you want praise.\n\n*How did you think of that? You’re a genius!*\n\nOr again, maybe it’s just fun to discuss the idea with family and friends.\n\nKeep it to yourself (for now). Based on what I said earlier sharing your idea right away may not serve you. On the contrary, it opens the door for “challenge” and [if you already struggle with fear](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/), “challenge” won’t help you, it will validate your fear.\n\nInstead, take immediate action.\n\n![idea reality](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/vFNF6EIw4CEmwAaMeO488/05724be709cd3579fbb0a777163ace46/IdeaReality2.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center> *[Sign up for Shine](http://www.shinetext.com) for daily life advice via text.* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2. Explore Vs. Plan\n\nAll too often when we have an idea we get bogged down in the planning. How is it going to work? What do I need to do? What will it look like five years from now?\n\nWhat if we let others guide us in the planning?\n\nFor example, my friend Tim found inspiration while visiting wine country in Europe. He loved the wine, but he noticed none of the wineries served food…and he wanted to eat! And there an idea to fill this gap was born.\n\nRather than plan any further, Tim should explore by calling five wineries in the area. He can ask questions to identify their needs and understand why they don’t serve food. Not only would this satisfy his curiosity, but what may result is a completely new solution, one he hasn’t thought of yet.\n\nIn *Big Magic*, Elizabeth Gilbert speaks extensively about the power of following your curiosity. She says:\n\n*“I didn’t desperately want a garden, understand. I wasn’t prepared to die for a garden, or anything. I just thought a garden would be nice. Curious. The whim was small enough that I could have ignored it. It barely had a pulse. But I didn’t ignore it. Instead, I followed that small clue of curiosity, and I planted some things.”*\n\nAnd this is how she came to write *The Signature of All Things.*\n\n\n![IdeaReality3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3v2ixaaaRysW6WwIQ0gKAC/78f4391bb4cec41439375626a5e83238/IdeaReality3.jpg)\n\n## 3. Brainstorm Freely\n\nAll too often our vision is limited by what we can or can’t do.\n\nThis is a personal pain point that I fight daily as I plan out[ my program Work Bigger.](http://bit.ly/2knZbAy) For example, technology isn’t my strong suit so I should not build a tech platform.\n\nThis makes sense to an extent. [We should do work where we can exercise our strengths.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/6-shoulds-to-abandon-right-now/) However, this point of view can also limit the possibilities, and the chance to have a breakthrough. What could we discover, invent, realize if we had the courage to get wild with our ideas?\n\nOne method used in design thinking is [flaring and focusing.](https://www.belmamccaffrey.com/learn-the-skill-to-solve-any-problem/)\n\nWhat I like about this method is that it helps manage the “but,” and the “reality check.” After a wild brainstorm session, we “focus” which means applying a reality check for our ideas among other criteria.\nBut before we even get to that, we can allow ourselves to come up with as many crazy ideas as possible.\n\n> Others’ perspectives are key as it allows us to draw on their experiences and knowledge.\n\nTo do this effectively, find an open space. A large whiteboard and post it notes help so you can group ideas later on. More importantly, defer judgement during the brainstorm, go nuts, and write down as many ideas as possible.\n\nAnother option is to live the questions for a couple of days. Personally, I sometimes find it difficult to brainstorm under pressure. So instead I spend two to three days in thought thinking about my idea, meditating on it, and writing things down as they come up. I then revisit all my options and apply the “reality check” filter.\n\n## 4. Create a “Braintrust”\n\nWhile reading Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace, I stumbled on the idea of a “braintrust.” At Pixar, filmmakers come together to provide candid feedback on their projects. The goal is to identify flaws in a product and help projects make the shift from mediocre to great.\nWhen discussing the process of true creativity, Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar says the ideas don’t start out great. It’s only through feedback and constant iteration that greatness is achieved.  \n\nAchieving a breakthrough is unlikely to be done alone. Others’ perspectives are key as it allows us to draw on their experiences and knowledge.\n\nYou may not need a braintrust right away, but [you need a group of people who are solution oriented](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/) and have your best interest at heart to help you take your idea to the next level.\n\n## In Conclusion: To Go From Idea to Reality\n\nLet’s be mindful of how we approach the idea process. What if rather than simply engaging in discussion and posing unseen challenges, we engage in more action? What could happen?\n\nCreativity resides deep within us. We just have to access it.\n\n[READ NEXT: 4 Ways To Work Your Professional Network](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/)\n\n\n<font color=\"#808080\"> * Lissma/Shutterstock.com* </font>\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"tags":{"en-US":["ideas","advice","brainstorm"]},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Idea Reality Gets in the Way","description":"Do you have an idea but reality gets in the way","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/7fhv1HqsDKwCmGaiEQIkcM/7553f4f7989fd30a8305e116303c6d87/IdeaReality.jpg","details":{"size":366013,"image":{"width":1000,"height":588}},"fileName":"IdeaReality.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"description":{"en-US":"Follow these 4 steps if you have a great idea but \"reality\" gets in the way."},"date":{"en-US":"2017-01-30T13:00"},"category":{"en-US":"work"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"author":{"name":"Belma McCaffrey","bio":"<p>Belma McCaffrey is a writer, mentor and the founder of <a href=\"https://www.belmamccaffrey.com/workbiggerschool/\">Work Bigger</a>, a mentorship program and community empowering 20 to 30-somethings to get more focused, be more decisive and get big things done.

You’ve left your full-time office job to pursue your career as an entrepreneur. Things are coming together: your website just launched, you’ve landed your first few clients, and you’re working tirelessly to establish yourself as an expert in your industry. \n\nAnd your office is coming together too—except your office is actually a tiny corner in your kitchen where your laptop is perched precariously on a table edge, surrounded by both important work papers and dirty dishes. (From breakfast? Last night?) In this scenario—all too real for some of us—it’s easy to imagine feeling overwhelmed. Especially in the beginning months of being an entrepreneur, it’s common to work long hours across days and weeks that lack any apparent routine. If that’s you, here are some ways to create structure and work smarter, not longer. \n\n> Letting yourself have a mini reset is just as important as tackling your to-do list.\n\n## 1. Identify your golden hours. \nPhotographers refer to the golden hour (or magic hour) as the time shortly before sunrise or after sunset when the light is soft and perfect. Rather than constantly adjusting, they can take many photos in succession. We all have golden hours in our days—those periods of time where we are focused and the conditions are right so that we can work undistracted. For example, some people like to tackle emails in the evening, when they aren’t constantly interrupted by another incoming message. Some prefer to work on creative or long-term projects in the early morning hours when they feel refreshed from a good night’s sleep. \n\nEveryone is different, but once you identify your hours of highest productivity as it relates to different tasks, you can begin to structure your day to capitalize on (and protect) those windows of time.  \n\n![structure3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6O7tG8Y7NC4kwiw06W0aGw/c786bdf3ed7d12076187163e4066812c/structure3.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center> [Sign up for Shine](http://shinetext.com) for daily life advice. </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2. Carve out time for yourself.\nYou need to sleep, eat, take care of yourself, and interact with the outside world. It’s counter-intuitive, but if you’re working from home, you can easily forget to get up from your desk and grab something out the fridge. Don’t let yourself sacrifice your well-being; [think of self-care as an important part of your daily routine.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/kristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care/) \n\nIf you belong to a gym, take a break and get a workout in. If you meditate or practice yoga, find time for a quick session (and make sure you leave the room where you’ve been working). Go for a walk and breathe the fresh air. Letting yourself have a mini reset is just as important as tackling your to-do list. [Scheduling a break](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/) ahead of time can help you feel in control, and it also reinforces the importance of sticking to the plan.\n\n> You have to protect your time in the way that works best for you.\n\n## 3. Understand that not everyone will understand.\nEntrepreneurs are a supportive bunch, and anyone who has embarked on solopreneurship will understand how important it is that you [stick to your established routine](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-importance-of-a-daily-routine/), despite having the freedom to switch it up. \n\nSome people, however, won’t understand that you aren’t always available, despite the fact that you make your own schedule. People generally have good intentions; they want to see you, grab lunch with you, or go on an impromptu adventure. Sometimes, family members, thinking that you’re free, will request an errand or a favor. Whether or not you change your plans is up to you—that’s the beauty of working on your own terms. But you shouldn’t feel any shame in declining plans, especially if they disrupt your schedule in a way that will be hard to correct and result in days of scrambling. You have to protect your time in the way that works best for you.  \n\n![structure2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4EH6W9Wf8cGMYoCyuSQooC/c2c53e94362f6e21761e9736c249ba6a/structure2.jpg)\n\n## 4. Switch it up.\nIf you’ve been working from home, try venturing out to a coffee shop or coworking space. A change of scenery can energize and focus you, and getting a coffee or pastry is a nice treat to change up your day. If you want to give coworking a try, search for spots in your city or make a date with a friend to have an informal coworking date. You can hunker down in a café, an apartment, a library—wherever, as long as it’s not your little corner in your kitchen. \n\nWhen you work alongside a friend or colleague, you can bounce ideas off each other while keeping each other company and cheering each other on. At home, try adding desk accessories to your space. A splash of color or novelty can go a long way toward making your workspace feel productive again. \n\n<br>\n\n[READ NEXT: The Importance of a Daily Routine](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-importance-of-a-daily-routine/)\n<br>\n\n<font color=\"#808080\"> *(Photo credit: Eugenio Marongiu/Shutterstock.com)*\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"structure","description":"woman with laptop wearing flannel","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/uX2VpnBeYoiYIYeEC6yaM/572fa72c82892886d900f8ea03dd8f16/Create_structure_in_your_day.jpg","details":{"size":16985963,"image":{"width":7360,"height":4912}},"fileName":"Create structure in your day.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"work"},"tags":{"en-US":["structure","routine","self-care","time management "]},"description":{"en-US":"4 simple tips to help you create structure and work smarter, not longer.

Here are some ways to go about the breakup:\n\n\n##  Save the Drama (When You Can)\nThese relationships don't all have to end in a dramatic fashion. They can sometimes just fizzle out if you don’t fan the flames. If this friend is confrontational, it may be best to just not return their calls until they get the hint. While this form of ghosting might seem like taking the easy way out, remember that their drama is why you are breaking up with them in the first place.\n\n## Offer Your Point of View\nIf you feel the need to explain the relationship ending, you can simply tell them that[ the relationship feels very one-sided](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish/), \nand they don't seem to value you as a friend. They may not have realized their actions were hurtful, and you may even be able to salvage a friendship. However, don't plan on that happening. At least you can say you were honest and gave them the chance.\n\n## Lean on Positive Influences\nAnother step to take is to make new friends who make a positive impact on your life.\nFind common interests by joining a club or finding a hobby. Maybe there's a cooking class you have been wanting to take, or possibly someone at the gym you chat with sometimes. Making friends can be more difficult as we get older, but having a positive circle of friends will help you stay away from the negative relationships that leave you feeling unfulfilled and bad about yourself.\n\nNo matter how you end the relationship, it's important that you end it somehow. It will be better for your self esteem, and will help clear your schedule for the meaningful friendships you won't be missing out on anymore.\n\n<br>\n\n__READ NEXT: [3 Steps to Becoming Wisely Selfish](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish/)__\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Friend break up","description":"Friend break up smaller","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6WH0jwU9Ik4G0ukEqAKYM/0c6d604e11bf939e691b1c93fc080d43/shutterstock_457824571.jpg","details":{"size":297069,"image":{"width":993,"height":473}},"fileName":"shutterstock_457824571.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"life"},"tags":{"en-US":["toxic","friend","breakup"]},"description":{"en-US":"Here are three simple tips when your friendship has reached the point of no return."},"author":{"name":"Amber Sullivan","bio":"<p>Amber Sullivan works in Corporate and Strategic Messaging and is also a freelance writer.

As [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/fashion/post-election-anxiety-self-care.html?_r=1) wrote, a “search on Google Trends showed that self-care peaked in interest popularity from November 13th through November 19th, the largest increase in the last five years.”\n\nWe're all way too hard on ourselves about how we're doing in managing the many responsibilities we have to balance, which can quickly lead to burnout.\n\nAs a result, self-care isn't a ‘nice to have,’ it's a ‘need to have.’ Let's show ourselves the love we deserve in 2017.\n\nHere are my five tips to practice self-care this year:\n\n## 1. If you are low on self esteem, find an estimable act.\nGiving yourself to others takes the focus off yourself and allows for immediate perspective, which inadvertently boosts your feelings of gratitude and worth. Helping others truly is helping yourself.\n\n> We're all way too hard on ourselves about how we're doing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22We%E2%80%99re%20all%20way%20too%20hard%20on%20ourselves%20about%20how%20we%E2%80%99re%20doing.%22%20-%20%40IMKristenBell&amp;via=ShineText&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadvice.shinetext.com%2Farticles%2Fkristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care%2F&amp;original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fst-webcontent-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Farticles%2Fkristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n## 2. Forgive yourself.\nBe a [Disney Princess](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/working-young-bubbly-and-female-the-disney-princess-effect/) and LET IT GO. That song became a sensation, because the message is universally powerful, defying gender and age. The kindness and acceptance that we bestow on others, should also be turned inward on ourselves. The most effective way to move forward and experience growth is through self-pardon.\n\n## 3. Re-evaluate your current measure of stress.\nCher once told me, \"If it doesn't matter in 5 years, it doesn't matter.\" I think about this often and find myself consistently applying the rule. If I'm feeling caught up in routine annoyances, I start to consider what I will be thinking about on my deathbed and my entire perspective shifts. It allows me to focus on what is, ultimately, worth remembering.\n\n> If it doesn't matter in 5 years, it doesn't matter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22If%20it%20doesn't%20matter%20in%205%20years%2C%20it%20doesn't%20matter.%22%20-%20%40IMKristenBell&amp;via=ShineText&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadvice.shinetext.com%2Farticles%2Fkristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care%2F&amp;original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fst-webcontent-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Farticles%2Fkristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\n## 4.  Lean on people.\nDon't let your ego prevent you from obtaining support from others. There is a mightiness that comes with [asking for help](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-things-you-should-know-about-intersectionality-and-self-care/), being vulnerable and not going at it alone.\n\n## 5.

(Hint: it’s not “busy” and doesn’t start with “f.”)\n\nStatus update: the word “just” should be banished from your vocab. Too many of us use this seemingly harmless word in emails, in conversations, and even in our minds.\n\nTo be clear, there are still two instances where “just” is hundy p justified:\n\n1) Just do it. <br>\n2) Just desserts (as in, “I am only eating desserts”).\n\n\nYou might feel that using “just” all the time is NBD, but once you realize how it undermines you when speaking and when rationalizing with yourself, you will cut it out -- stat.\n\nHere are the 3 scenarios where we tend to use “just” -- and not doing ourselves any justice at all.\n\n## In Email\n*“Hi! I’m just following up on my email from last week….”*\n\n*“Hi! I’m just emailing to confirm our meeting next week.”*\n\nNow consider how much more assertive you would sound if you deleted “just” altogether and it went more like this:\n\n*“Hi! I’m following up on my email from last week….”*\n\n*“Hi! I’m emailing you to confirm our meeting next week.”*\n\nStronger, right?\n\nThe truth is, when we add the word “just” it’s usually innocent and serves as filler to make an email flow better.\n\nBut when we take a closer look, it sounds apologetic. It reads like this: “I don’t mean to bother you, I’m really just contacting you again to [follow up / confirm / check in].\n\nTara Mohr, a career and personal growth coach who teaches women worldwide how to step into their power, covers this in her book, *Playing Big: Practical Wisdom for Women Who Want to Speak Up, Create & Lead.* According to Mohr, women are “playing small,” so she shares the tools she’s used to help women take big steps forward in their lives and careers.\n\nMohr dedicates a chapter to “Communicating with Power,” and the words women tend to use that undermine them. These words are “the little things we do in our speech and writing that diminish our impact.” After all, Mohr reminds us that our words are our opportunity -- and using “just” is a ‘shrinker’ because it lessens the power of what we have to say.”\n\n> Using “just” is a ‘shrinker’ because it lessens the power of what we have to say.”\n\nBecause we want to be apologetic for asserting ourselves, we lean on words like “just” to ensure we don’t sound aggressive or harsh. This is no way to lean in, ladies.\n\nSo next time you’re drafting an email, strike out the word “just.” It will make you sound confident, strong and assertive. Just. Like. That.   \n\n\n![Just2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/ugGPOtw5peSAAK2yYmmeQ/6837a62d94be9481000d55e47f636f3d/Just2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](https://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living you best life via text* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n## In Meetings & Converations with Coworkers/Clients\n\n*\"I just want to explain…”*\n\n*“I just think…”*\n\n*“I just want to make sure I understand your point of view here...\"*\n\n\nWhy are we asking for permission to validate our understanding of others’ P.O.V.? Or worse, asking for permission to explain our own stance?\n\nThe “I just want” and “I just think” needs to stop right here, right now. To be fair, these are likely harder to control, because [speaking with confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/) and assertion can be more challenging in person. Email and social media allow for the kind of anonymity that make it easier to speak your mind since you’re not face-to-face -- whereas you might feel more insecure or feel the need to please in a meeting or client call.\n\nSo here is your mental reminder to kick “just” to the curb. If you’re worried about coming off too harsh, Mohr recommends remaining kind and diplomatic with your tone of voice, choice of words and body language.\n\nYou can slay those meetings without using “just”!\n\n\n## To Ourselves\n*(Says to self)*\n\n*\"I will let the client get away with it, just this once.\"*\n\n*\"I will say yes, just this time...\"*\n\n*\"I will just get over this crazy period, and will then get myself more organized.\"*\n\nWhatever kind of boss you are, the excuses need to stop. In this scenario, “just” is the word that’s hindering your progress.\n\n> \"Whatever kind of boss you are, the excuses need to stop.\"\n\nBy allowing yourself to take on a project for less than your usual rate, accepting to be treated disrespectfully, or not pushing back on requests, you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\nShow your clients that you have limits and that it’s not okay for them to [insert shady verb here] you over.\n\nWhen you’re “just-ing” all over yourself, it becomes an excuse to put things off -- like taking control of your life and saying no.\n\nThe “just” is a Band-Aid solution. It makes you feel good in the moment and makes you feel like you’ve got this. Because it’s just one all-nighter. It’s just one week of putting off the gym to make it through this crazy period. It’s just one week of being tied to your laptop and not talking to family or friends. And it’s just a month of asking yourself, “How did I accept to take on this project -- for this deadline -- for zero pay?”\n\nBut in reality, it’s all a distraction -- and it’s preventing you from moving forward.\n\n## Just the Facts\nFor a small word, “just” can cause some real damage -- to your reputation and your reality. Banish this word from your repertoire altogether and be fair to yourself.\n\n<br>\n\n[READ NEXT: How to Journal Yourself Happier](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Create and Cultivate ","bio":"<p>Create &amp; Cultivate is a movement for women looking to create &amp; cultivate the career of their dreams. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"create cultivate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1bTeT49xZOEyusq6cU40kO/447ed90d92c9d0c36bedcebc4cddef30/cc.jpeg","details":{"size":8039,"image":{"width":271,"height":186}},"fileName":"cc.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"work"},"description":{"en-US":"Here are the 3 scenarios where we tend to use “just” -- and not doing ourselves any justice at all.\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"date":{"en-US":"2017-01-17T14:43"},"tags":{"en-US":["confidence","advice","work"]},"id":"22aSBgmJmEYauQGekMcQGs","urlPath":"articles/why-just-is-the-most-unfair-word/"},{"title":{"en-US":"3 Steps to Becoming Wisely Selfish"},"slug":{"en-US":"3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish"},"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s children, we are taught that it is better to give than it is to receive, but often the message becomes garbled on the path to adulthood. When thinking of how to increase our personal happiness, we tend to think in black and white terms: “I must be selfless,” or “I must focus on myself completely.” The former is almost impossible to achieve, and the latter does nothing but send us into downward spirals of self-absorption. \n<br>\n\n> Cherishing others is a stepping stone to leading a happy and fulfilling life. \n\n\nWe forget that we don’t need to be either of these things; we simply need to be who we’ve always been, but with a bit more palpable compassion. Giving back and helping out is beneficial for all parties involved. You get that “warm, fuzzy feeling” from doing a good deed, and at the end of the day, something is achieved. \n\n![Volunteering](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5MQd4FGwlUoAeQE0yG6UEE/d3c4d50e2783efde5ec59c97b6053491/Volunteering.jpg)\n\nThe Dalai Lama describes this as being “wisely selfish”: you are thinking of yourself when giving back, but you are not thinking only of yourself. According to him, cherishing others is a stepping stone to leading a happy and fulfilling life. \n<br>\n\n## Why it works: \nBeing absorbed with your own needs is detrimental because it pushes you to focus only on the occurrences within your own world, including the negative ones. You may have a great week of self-encouragement spurred by a well-done report at work, but the minute a colleague is praised instead of you, you’ll be sent into a frenzy of questioning and disappointment. \n\nConversely, focusing on others allows you to escape the negatives in your own world. By being there for others and making a difference, you are allowing yourself to become a part of something bigger than a day-to-day work schedule. Helping others allows you to see the value of your own life, even on days that feel particularly draining or confusing.\n\n[Studies](http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/slinden/files/helpershigh.pdf) show that the reward section of the brain is triggered when people give to charity. This “helper’s high” is likened to the feeling we get after eating chocolate or having sex. While it’s counterproductive to force yourself to give back as another item on your to-do list, thinking of it as a reward gives it the potential to turn a difficult day into a great one. \n<br>\n>  Figure out what makes your heart full.\n\n## How to do it: \n\nCommitting to three simple steps will make this lifestyle a reality and bring you the happiness you deserve.  \n<br>\n\n__1. Pick a cause you’re passionate about. __\n\nIt is hard to think of charity as a fun activity if you’re doing something that doesn’t fulfill or intrigue you. If you’re a nature lover, it makes sense to sign up for a day of service cleaning up a park or neighborhood. Conversely, cleaning up a park can be the worst thing in the world for someone who doesn’t love being outside. Get to know yourself and [figure out what makes your heart full](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/), whether it is [reading to children](http://pajamaprogram.org/), working at a [soup kitchen](http://holyapostlessoupkitchen.org/), or [beautifying a school.](https://www.changeforkids.org/)\n\n\n__2. Give your time. __ \n\nSimply knowing what you want to do is not enough to reap the rewards of being wisely selfish. Depending on your schedule, you can make charity work a regular, planned event in your calendar. Not only will you be triggering the reward section of your brain more often, but you will also build relationships within the community you are giving back to. By becoming a part of someone else’s routine or schedule, you can fortify your sense of purpose and importance. \n\n__3. Don’t feel guilty.__  \n\nThere will be days where you’re not able to do the charity work you’ve planned, and that’s okay! Pressuring yourself will do nothing but send you into that downward spiral of self-absorption again. Be realistic with your goals, and reflect on the good you have done when you can’t make it to every single soup kitchen shift. After all, you are doing this for you. Instead of setting expectations, set a wish list. It will keep you excited for future prospects while quieting the part of you that wants to nag—nobody gets everything they ask for on a wish list. \n\n[READ NEXT: 3 Ways to Break Up with a Toxic Friend](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-break-up-with-a-toxic-friend/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Woman Smiling","description":"Woman smiling holding arms in nature","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1RG6NU3D1OAmOuCmIkOi6C/5e76d2501b6d86ac1b4167ae72c4e083/shutterstock_415623718.jpg","details":{"size":365688,"image":{"width":1000,"height":666}},"fileName":"shutterstock_415623718.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Brittany Burgos","bio":"<p>Brittany Burgos is a junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology studying Communications.

It's been proven to lead to greater [emotional wellbeing](http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/JRPbrief.pdf) and is linked to less depression, anxiety and stress.\n\n> 80% percent of resolutions fail by mid-February.\n\nPsychologist and researcher, Dr. Kristen Neff, defines self-compassion in three abilities: self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness. \n\n## Self-kindness \n...is about flipping the script and reserving judgement on ourselves (studies have shown that we are 3 times more likely to feel compassion for a total stranger). \n\nIf we are struggling to meet a goal, there are probably valid reasons. Recognize that you’re going to do the best you can, and when you have off days - empathize with where you’re coming from.\n\n## Common humanity \n...is about realizing that we all are imperfect beings. \n\n![shutterstock 521800396 (1)](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5vF2DRbyMMCg0GMEuA42yO/5fb946bbfdd5f9e81b5f9c05e3e18a81/shutterstock_521800396__1_.jpg)\n\nRecognizing that you’re not alone and that you will doubtlessly hit roadblocks along the way, can empower you to rely on community and support for others in moments of self-criticism. There is a 100% chance that someone else has felt exactly the way you do, whether you’re crushing it or struggling.\n\n> “Self compassion helps bridge the gap between who we feel we are and who we really are,” says Dr. Rowley.\n\n## Mindfulness\n...is about cultivating an awareness. We can’t be kind to ourselves or rely on the power in shared humanity if we don’t recognize when we’re being particularly hard ourselves.\n\nAs Dr. Anna Rowley, Psychologist and millenniall wellbeing expert says, “we can separate ourselves from our negative thinking or feelings of inadequacy. Your boss chews you out for a report she doesn’t like. You have a choice - dwell on what a failure you are or practice mindfulness and acknowledge the feedback and do better next time. By separating ourselves from the emotion - anger, frustration, or self pity - we are available to problem solve.”\n\n> We are 3 times more likely to feel compassion for a total stranger than for ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately there is a common misconception, that being compassionate with ourselves means that we’re going to take it easy, give ourselves a pass to never improve or become set in our ways.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-01 at 8.41.19 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6IcfJsMdtmGgkAW8uySyO2/5973d511b3667f65033b13e00da42552/Screen_Shot_2016-09-01_at_8.41.19_AM.png)\n\nBut the reality is, that when we focus on empathizing with ourselves and meeting ourselves where we are - we can set goals that build on our strengths and realistically help us improve.\n\n“Self compassion helps bridge the gap between who we feel we are and who we really are,” says Dr. Rowley.\n\nShe continues: \n\n“Resolutions are hard to change because we are trying to alter aspects of ourself we aren’t happy with or behaviors we may have ‘lived’ for a long, long time. Many of us set unrealistic or unreasonable goals. \n\nFor example, \"I will go to the gym 4 times this week”might be a tough resolution to keep if you have never been to a gym before or you are embarrassed walking into a room full of strangers grunting and heaving. Self compassion is about reducing the risk of feeling like a failure if you don’t nail your immediate goal. \n\nIt also helps us set more realistic compassionate goals. Rather than join a gym I’ll go for a walk or next time I shop I’ll look for a more healthy choice of foods. Self-compassion can help us make smarter choices and offer a helping hand when we mess up - and we will mess up.”\n\nSo, this year as you continue to grow, evolve and work on yourself - remember to set goals that allow you to be kind to yourself.\n\nNeed help? We got you. Now you can set intentions for what you want to work on and get customized messages from Shine.

Internal battles, relationship struggles and external pressures can combine to feel like the weight of the world is weighing down on our shoulders - making it hard to find our \"cool.\"\n\nOne suggestion: tone down the stress and find levity with some playful calming techniques. Yep. [A recent study found](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170111102859.htm) that being more playful can actually help you live longer.\n\nHere are a few more scientifically proven methods to lighten things up. When the going gets tough, go with the lab coats and test tubes every time. \n\n## 1. Tune In\n\nListening to music has a calming effect — but only certain tunes. No electronic, hard rock, punk or hip-hop. Those just rev you up more. Soothing songs that might already be on you playlist include:\n\n•\tColdplay’s “Strawberry Swing”\n\n•\t“Watermark” by Enya\n\n•\tAdele’s “Someone Like You”\n\nOne of the most [serenity-inducing songs](http://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent.html) of all time is “Weightless” by Marconi Union. It was actually composed with input from sound therapists to lower heart rate, blood pressure and the stress hormone cortisol. But if you’re a traditionalist and want stress relief unencumbered by the scientific process, try Mozart’s “Canzonetta Sull'aria.” \n\n![headphones](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/39VeN2QE36WckU4omsy6q0/5963dc466dec2ac4ad0aa103f01ec431/shutterstock_292011599.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center> [Sign up for Shine](http://www.shinetext.com) for daily life advice via text. </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2. LOL\n\nWhat makes you laugh? Cat videos on YouTube? Slapstick? Deadpan humor? Satire? Standup comedians? Whatever tickles your funny bone, use it to reduce stress. The [physical act of laughing](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456) calms your body. It brings in more oxygen, relaxes muscles and boosts blood circulation, all good things to combat stress. Over time, laughter also enhances the immune system, reduces pain and eases clinical depression. \n\nWhen your anxiety levels rise, turn to your favorite Kevin Hart movie, Weird Al album or Calvin and Hobbes collection. Find something to make you chuckle, and you’ll feel better before you know it. While you’re still grinning, share the joke with others and make their day, too. \n\n## 3. Get Green\n\nWhen you get a chance, thank a plant for adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the air. But also give it a nod for reducing stressful feelings. [Being around plants is calming](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/29/best-houseplants-destress_n_2964013.html), so introduce a few to your surroundings. Don’t go overboard. You don’t want to start worrying about having to water them all. \n\nGreenery that’s especially beneficial indoors includes:\n\n•\tAloe plants\n•\tPhilodendrons\n•\tRubber trees\n•\tSnake plants\n•\tSpider plants\n\nNot only do these green guys enrich your physical and mental space, they’re also easy to care for. You won’t be saddled with guilt for accidently killing your stress-reliever. \n\n## 4. Engage in Some Monkey Business\n\nWhen you’re stressed out, your blood pressure shoots up. You know the long-term effects of this: diuretics, anyone? Eating a healthy diet helps keep blood pressure under control, and a favorite snack of our simian friends is especially helpful. An ordinary banana can have extraordinary effects. The mineral potassium counters the pressure-raising effects of eating too much salt. Baked potatoes, orange juice and yogurt bring on the potassium, too. \n\n## 5. Act Like a Kid\n\nEver get jealous of little kids? They have it easy, breezing through life, hitting the playground and skipping through parks. \n\n![Kid](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6V9A5dROjm828Q2cWgUCkM/540fb91ed4c928a5706ac5b1b3f5418e/shutterstock_508069513.jpg)\n\n\nThough you may no longer comfortably fit on a swing, you will find chewing gum reduces stress. Chewing – quietly of course, you don’t want to bother your coworkers – also helps you feel more alert makes it easier to multitask. Work your jaws, and you can address greeting cards, plan a party and watch your favorite seasonal video, all at the same time. \n\n[READ NEXT: How to Journal Yourself Happier](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"title":{"en-US":"5 Simple Ways to Lighten Up When Things Feel Heavy"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"woman laughing","description":"black woman curly hair laughing","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3ckAODvdCMs0yS4AAUMqaO/0e955db93d579f1773fcd8f3460a7ea3/shutterstock_483745342.jpg","details":{"size":4948001,"image":{"width":4300,"height":2866}},"fileName":"shutterstock_483745342.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Sarah Landrum","bio":"<p>Sarah Landrum is a career and happiness expert and the founder of Punched Clocks.

There was nothing personal about my writing in my journal. It was filled with checkmarks and arrows and names to call, email, follow up with followed by flat out begging that something would shift. \n\nAfter reaching my breaking point, I turned off my phone, sat down with a cup of coffee, grabbed a blue pen and I let myself write. \n\n![createherstock-holiday-16-5](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1TVLT5AQYkSSMsaWesIkQs/f2cf67f57d8dcaf7de8a96943933c926/createherstock-holiday-16-5.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up for Shine](http://www.shinetext.com) for more daily inspiration .* </center>\n\n---\n\nFor weeks, I wrote. \n\n•   I wrote about my anger for [feeling so burned out](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/). \n\n•   I wrote about my dreams of wanting something different. \n\n•   I wrote about what I wanted to do next. \n\n•   I wrote about ways I longed to feel happy again. \n\nI was deliberately asking myself questions that I didn’t know the questions to. \n\nExamples of questions I asked: \n\n•\t  How would it feel if I quit working? \n\n•\t  Who would be disappointed in me if that happened? \n\n•\t  What has to change in order for me to have the life of my dreams? \n\n•\t  Why am I not happy? \n\n> After reaching my breaking point, I turned off my phone, grabbed a pen and I let myself write. \n\n\nEach new question lead me down a rabbit hole of discovering something I couldn’t easily access any other way. \n\nThe more I wrote, the better I felt.\n\nThe more I wrote, the less stressed I felt.\n\nThe more I wrote, the more I changed. \n\n![cklhktcjzkk-aaron-burden](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2CZUkKgFhmOUwUso0s62uA/f62e235e8a07c4460fdba784f6b196ca/cklhktcjzkk-aaron-burden.jpg)\n\nUntil one day, I realized I had become the shift I was craving. I had journaled myself happier. \n\nMy [addiction to my job](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-sober-up-from-your-busy-ness-addiction/) was a pattern I couldn’t break any other way but through the pages of my journal. I tried doctors, exercise, food, different food, different doctors. It came down to my own patterns and reformatting them in my journal. I was able to reframe my thoughts, beliefs, patterns and stories that cluttered my day and mind. I saw a shift in my mood, behaviors and overall state of well-being within a matter of two months. \n\nResearch out of University of Texas at Austin, shows that journaling about emotions and stress actually boost our immune system and in turn reducing the impact of the stress on our physical health. \n\nIt also shows that journaling helps clarify our thoughts and feelings, helps us know ourselves better and increases our problem-solving ability. With a clearer mind, I could de-stress myself before I stressed myself. \n\nAfter moving through the motions, journaling helped me find the underlining issue of my addiction to my job. Writing out that old pattern from an objective point-of-view allowed me the space I needed to get myself in check. If my health and peace of mind were both lost, I’d have more than just my job to worry about. That was my line. \n\nHere are three tips to help you dig deeper in your own journal. \n\n## Let It Flow\nFree form writing is always a good way to start when you don’t know where to start. What I found even more beneficial was to free form write around a specific question. Ask yourself a question you know could be a trigger for you and just let whatever comes up spill out onto the pages of your journal. When you’ve poured it all out, go back and read your work. \n\n## Reflect on What You Wrote\nMost people stop at writing. They let the emotions spill out in hopes that just getting it out will change something. I don’t stop there. I go back and read whatever I wrote in my free form exercise. \n\n![journal5](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5kbpzxVeRqskGu6ueacEqc/86d5ceae4a8d2d01275d52d32b14adf1/journal5.jpeg)\n\nI highlight things that really trigger me somehow – either positively or negatively. I know those little pieces are the parts that I have to pay more attention to if I want to move past whatever I’m stuck on. \n\n## Morning Memoirs \nSchedule your journaling session each morning before your day gets going. It’s best if you’re able to journal for 20 minutes each day, however, if that’s too much start at just 10 minutes a day. \n\nUse the same journal every day to capture your thoughts and let your morning be your time to really sink into your stories. Sit in the same spot every day and make sure and set your alarm. When you’re done writing, be sure to reflect for a few minutes and be proud of the self-development work you’re doing. \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Simple Ways to Lighten Up When Things Feel Heavy\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"How to Journal Yourself Happier"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-journal-yourself-happier"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"journalheader","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/rpsqcqGRbMGumGwcquqii/225e333e9612acb93591fa5c1cfa0ab4/journalheader.jpg","details":{"size":232498,"image":{"width":1404,"height":796}},"fileName":"journalheader.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-12-14T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Carrie Severson","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.carrieseverson.com\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Severson</a> is an entrepreneur and storyteller trainer who teaches leaders how to step into their stories and share their lessons.

At a deadlock. In a rut.\n\nWe have all at, one point or another, felt like we were running in a predictable, endless circle to nowhere. This is not to be confused with how we go about following our day-to-day routines and obligations, and even, in how we combat our minor daily frustrations. \n\nIt is one giant step further than that: we get this deep sense of unshakable malaise. It stunts our growth. It zaps our desire for discovery.\n\nThe good news is that there is no need to fear any of this. It’s perfectly normal.\n\n“This feeling of being stuck in one place, while troubling, is part of a necessary crisis leading to personal growth, says Dr. Timothy Butler, Senior Fellow and Director of Career Development Programs at Harvard Business School. ‘Without it we cannot grow, change, and – eventually – live more fully in a larger world,’ Butler writes in his book, [Getting Unstuck: How Dead Ends Become New Paths](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Unstuck-Guide-Discovering-Career/dp/1422132323) (Harvard Business School Press).”\n\nAnd this “stuck” place is exactly where I found myself. I was feeling impossibly restless and unable to move forward over the last three years. I had experienced heartbreak and had battled some health issues. I had attempted to rebuild: I did cleanses, read voraciously, took an assortment of classes, threw myself into work and traveled as much as possible. Yet, I found myself with this mental and heart block that just wouldn’t relent, especially in the last six months. \n\nSo, I did what any person with their head in the clouds – and feet firmly planted in the ground – would do. \n\nI decided to take a monthlong life break in Berlin.\n\n![9yuvv 5lzxy-alfonso-cenname](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5NRSOze9zOkUmYCsu8SUko/2b383872fb713c729dea292976a98fc9/9yuvv_5lzxy-alfonso-cenname.jpg)\n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up for Shine](https://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living you best life via text* </center>\n\n---\n\nLooking back now, taking this step was years in the making. As a recent university graduate, I had vehemently declined my friend’s request to back pack through Europe as I needed to find a job and had no time or money to “just take a break.” Now, fifteen years later, I resigned from a great job to find myself taking up that offer to rest and take stock.\n\n> I found myself with this mental and heart block that just wouldn’t relent\n\nFor any modern person who is overextended, too connected and feeling stuck, this could be just the right way to get refreshed, find a new perspective and even get off the grid for a while.\n\nSo, a few practical steps to explore before you decide to press pause can include:\n\n## ALERT-ALERT-ALERT - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP\nThink through why this life break will be useful for you. Are you too comfortable in your current situation? Are you burned out from work and life? Is there a passion project you’ve been wanting to focus on? Is there a fun skill you’ve been wanting to develop? Is there a life experience you’ve always wanted to have?\n\n\n![busysub](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2zhGtuFtw0qI04gK8w6iSy/6c45c63ddb08955a6c303bbe1107a76f/busysub.jpg)\n\n## Make sure you have some financial cushion. \n[Save up](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-your-money-management-can-instantly-boost-your-happiness/) to three times of what you’ll think you’ll need for your break. This will provide some runway as you decide to either extend your stay and/or start job searching for the right new opportunity.\n\n\n## Decide where you want to stay for your break. \nFind connections in your network to help ease the transition into the new town or city you will be residing in. This can also be helpful in securing a home to rent!\n\n\n## Figure out logistics for this new town/city. \nDo you need to get a visa sorted out? How about insurance, including travel and health? Do you need to add an international data plan to your mobile device services? Make sure you have a universal outlet adaptor when abroad!\n\n![0yuh4tiqiyy-markus-spiske](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/tQwo2BZSHm6iSS0caSWyA/f01fda170576b64f3c2b7b1828bff9a7/0yuh4tiqiyy-markus-spiske.jpg)\n\n\n## Figure out logistics for back home. \nDo you plan to keep your current home? Do you want to rent it out? Make sure to notify all banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions about your travel plans. Do you have anyone that can keep watch of your pets, plants and mail?\n\n> Control is limited in the best of circumstances\n\n## Nail down a loose objective for your break to create some structure to your time. \nWhat do you want from it? Time to travel and experience new cultures? A detox from a harried and tech-addicted lifestyle? Or a start to what you think could be your next chapter in life? \n\nIt can be downright terrifying to take a life break and walk into the unknown, the undefined. This can especially be the case for those of us who have an M.O. of planning things out and even pride ourselves on exerting [control over our lives](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/) at all times (FYI: control is limited in the best of circumstances!). \n\nBut it is for these exact reasons that we need to be open to the learned and necessary art of letting go. Take it from me – it’s been uncomfortable as anything! But, much to my surprise, it has been the most life-affirming experience too.\n\n[READ NEXT: The 4 Rs You Need to Recover From a Mistake\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-rs-you-need-to-recover-from-a-mistake/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"How a \"Life Break\" Can Get You Unstuck"},"slug":{"en-US":"taking-a-life-break-to-get-unstuck"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Break","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1kJ7UgOykwum4W0yoK2Iig/c7feda93e7360590e275baba5a5a9f1b/break.jpg","details":{"size":1385010,"image":{"width":3888,"height":1729}},"fileName":"break.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-12-06T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Ji Son Choi","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jschoi\">Ji Son Choi </a>is a creative strategist who collaborates with brands to bring their values and stories to life via custom content and technology.

It’s not just putting your head down and doing the work, but it’s battling back those feelings of insecurity that creep to the surface. \n\nWomen often feel like they’re never good enough, according to Katty Kay and Claire Shipman in “[The Confidence Gap](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/).”\n\nIt can be demoralizing and self-destructive to let that voice take over, and for some women, it can be hard to climb up that steep hill of [self-doubt](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/). “Compared with men, women don’t consider themselves as ready for promotions, they predict they’ll do worse on tests, and they generally underestimate their abilities. This disparity stems from factors ranging from upbringing to biology,” writes Kay and Shipman. \n\n> Failure is its own reward, so be a risk taker. \n\nSure, sometimes all it takes is listening to Demi Lovato’s “Confident” on loop or buying schoolboy blazers, but there are other tricks and tips to help quell [those feelings](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/working-young-bubbly-and-female-the-disney-princess-effect/). \n\nSo, in a rather unscientific study — but a very #LeanInTogether type of experiment — I reached out to a few of my friends who are Beyoncé-level fierce — smart, successful, and undeniably aspirational — to see how they tackle their own confidence issues. \n\n\n## Know your value. \nMaria Gallucci says as a reporter it can be hard not to compare herself with other journalists “whose accomplishments stretch for miles.” When she’s in a funk, Maria reminds herself “that my true value isn't just the sum of my accomplishments,” she says. \n\n“And when I remember that, I have plenty to be proud of and plenty to bring to the table.”\n\n\n![Confidence 2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/7eS2zW8Iz6qKcywYASCCgU/8685a03d0d2066244c4fb5de26022c89/StockSnap_MSNQMQOC7W.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living your best life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## Congratulate yourself. \nConfidence isn’t only about feeling good about yourself but it’s also [believing in yourself](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/), so Emily Hanna Mayock, who works on the communications teams at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, turns to her “Good Things” folder. \n\n“Every time someone compliments me on my work, personality, attention to detail, I store that email,” she explains. “When I'm feeling down on myself, I go back and re-read one or two of those emails for an instant reminder that, hey, I am awesome.”\n\n## Ask for Feedback. \nAt Chipotle, where Katie Hanna works as a marketing strategist, the company focuses on empowerment, “and you can’t be empowered unless you're confident in your ability and encouraged by your circumstances,” she says. \n\n![Confidence ](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5PN8ICfIZ2QW4i2uk4qkm2/14e8f337f223e256c2a3ec2b47318ff6/confidence.jpeg)\n\nKatie does this through training, validation, and consistent one-on-ones with her manager. The feedback can be hard to hear but in the end it helps build self-esteem.\n\n\n## Take a Mental (and Physical) Break. \nLara Pham works as deputy director at an NGO in New York. It’s a high stress job, and Lara finds that, along with listening to a Wu-Tang Clan power anthem, “physically leaving the space where I felt my confidence drop helps. I then go somewhere where I can have some quiet to calm my mind and regain some mental control.” \n\n## Gain Perspective. \nMy sister (and role model for life) Chessa Rackovan works in the male-dominated field of dentistry and says those “preconceived notions of what a dentist should look like linger.” \n\n![perspective](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/43xWDNKzzqYMY880ySwgS0/fca0cbe35f2b6f01f8a350a24ce5df4d/perspective.jpg)\n\nWhen patients become apprehensive after she introduces herself as their dentist “that’s all it takes for me to feel self conscious.” She shuts those thoughts out, stops dwelling on them, and “looks ahead at what's next, and if all else fails, I drink some wine and then I'm my favorite person, dentist, mom.” Words to live by.\n\nFailure is its own reward, so be a risk taker. Women are generally risk averse and “tend to stick to the status quo,” says Warrell. \n\n> My true value isn't just the sum of my accomplishments.\n\nBy stepping outside of your comfort zone, the accomplishment (or failure) can be a great ego boost. \n\nI’m not a musician, for instance, but I recently taught myself how to play (a small bit of) “Call Your Girlfriend” on the piano—giving me mental fatigue and the musical sweats but ultimately turning a seemingly impossible task into a rewarding action (and a great party trick).\n\n[READ NEXT: Why *JUST* Is the Most Unfair Word](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/why-just-is-the-most-unfair-word/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"Mind the Gap"},"slug":{"en-US":"mind-the-gap"},"author":{"name":"Alissa Ponchione","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alissa_hdmag\">Alissa Ponchione</a> has worked in trade journalism for most of her career, writing for Nightclub &amp; Bar; Hotel News Now; and, currently, at Hospitality Design magazine.

They're like the Jones'. And require us to keep up in a way that steers us off our own track. \n\nIn fact, Eleanor Roosevelt’s famous counsel — “When you adopt the standards and the values of someone else … you surrender your own integrity,” is a fancy way of saying, drop the shoulds. Those rules by which everyone else is living. They are crazy-making. \n\nThere is no straight shot, one path, one-size-fits-all on the career or life climb. \n\nSo here are 6 shoulds we *suggest* you drop now. \n\n## 1. Should have known better.\nEvery one who's ever done anything important will tell you about mistakes they've made and how they were an integral part of the learning and growing process. The [mistakes are there to help you learn](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-4-rs-you-need-to-recover-from-a-mistake/).\n\nNo matter how many mistakes you make, you are ahead of everyone who isn't trying. \n\nMaybe you hired a friend, sent a slightly too aggressive email, stood your ground when it was time to bite your tongue. You live, you learn, and you adjust. You can't know better without knowing first. \n\n> \"You can't 'know better' without knowing first.\"\n\n\n## 2. Should be further in my career.\n\nThis is a mindset that affects every one in every decade of their life. \n\nWe want the better title. The bigger office. The higher paying [salary](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-your-money-management-can-instantly-boost-your-happiness/). And late at night when we're staring at the ceiling thinking about the how, the why, the when of it all, it's because we're bogged down (and kept up) by the idea that we should have had X experience and X success at this point.   \n\nBut what are we really comparing our lot against? If it's personal goals where you've missed the mark, think of ways to proactively achieve them. IF however you are [comparing your career to a friends](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/), stop and get some shut eye instead. \n\nTruly achieving your goals, means your success will not look like anyone else's-- that includes time frames. So you didn't write your masterpiece or make Forbes' 30 Under 30 list? 35 is as great a year to give it your all as 25. \n\n## 3. Should have thought of that first. \n\nWell, you didn't. Or maybe you did and you didn't act on it. Them's the breaks. So whaddya say we blow off this kind of thinking? The best move you can make is another one (and another one) and stop dwelling on what you didn't do. \n\nInstead of allowing someone else's successful idea to get you down, use it as aspirational inspiration. Sit down and find your own passion. (That's another thing we've learned. You need to be obsessed with your own idea in order to make your passion work.) \n\n## 4. Should have stuck my neck out. \nThere are opportunities that cross our paths multiple times a day. Sometimes we take advantage and other times we shy away from the conversation or confrontation. \n\nConference calls when we're silent. Board meetings when we let a colleague take credit for our idea. There are professional moments when it's smarter to take the quiet road (sometimes known as the high road). However if there is a situation that's haunting you, use it as fire for the next round of opps. You can't change the past, but the future is all yours. \n\n## 5. Should have been a mom by now. \nMillennials are waiting longer to have kids than ever before. And that's a good thing. You don't need to follow anyone's womb agenda. Period. \n\n## 6. Should've been a cowboy. \nToby Keith has some life regrets. He should have been a cowboy. He should have learned to rope and ride, but the truth is you can still make hay while the sun is shining.  \n\nThe point is, it's never too late to be a cowboy, or a cowgirl. All you need are the cojones to saddle up and ride right into your future.\n\n> \"It's never too late to be a cowboy.

It's the intensity you feel when discussing your political views. It's the feeling you get when you're fired up about a change you want to make in your life. It's the high of falling in love. It's the sometimes unbridled, unwieldy feelings that come when you're upset about an outcome of something you cannot change. It flows through you when you're creating something beautiful and also when you're dealing with something painful.\n\nWe all know what it's like to feel passion - yet we don't always realize when it's in front of us, ready to be utilized for positive change.\n\nWhy? Because it's easier to recognize the positive passions that engulf us when we're doing or feeling something that feels elevating or fulfilling. Some of the most underutilized of passionate emotions are ones like anger, frustration and dissapointment. \n\n> If you're passionate about something, it's likely clueing you into one of your many purposes in this world.\n\n\nWhile it's never convenient, finding the passion behind our *negative* emotions, can be one of the _most_ powerful agents for change that we can find within ourselves. \n\nHere are the three tips for channeling your everyday passion:\n\n## __Step 1: Be Aware Of Your Emotions__\nWhile you may or may not be doing what you're \"passionate about\" in your career or through school each day, there are likely everyday moments that trigger you positively and negatively. \n\nPay attention in those moments and you'll learn what your heart is telling you that you truly care about. \n\nDon't fully understand what your emotions are telling you you're passionate about? Move to step 2.\n\n## __Step 2: Find An Outlet__\nOne of the most frustrating things about our emotions is that they aren't always so clear in their message. But they're always trying to tell us *something.* For this reason, it's helpful to find positive outlets to channel our emotions and get help translating them. \n\n![createherstock-her-harbor-grace-4](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6GUOPcarXGC8mSWiyA2Mu/08080028c2d2136a86b8e21948657847/createherstock-her-harbor-grace-4.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for daily inspiration via text.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\nThere are infinite outlets around us. You just need to find one that works for you. Some ideas are: getting in touch with a friend, journaling on a consistent basis, meditating - or doing an activity that helps you get mindful like dancing, going on a hike, reading, etc. \n\nWhen your friend starts telling you she's sick of hearing you talk about how the world would be a better place if there were more cat-lovers, your journal entries quickly fill with drawings of bedazzled hijabs, or your Facebook comments flood with a bunch of 'dang, you spoke so well to that social injustice issue'- you may be onto something. \n\n## __Step 3: Act__\nIf you're passionate about something, it's likely clueing you into one of your many purposes in this world.  Once you start to connect the dots (ie. \"Oh yeah, I do always get fired up when someone talks about women's rights, maybe that's something I can get more tactically involved in.\"), it's time to do the work.\n\nStand up for yourself and the ideas you support, by finding ways to channel your passion into momentum.\n\n![photo-1478012168135-bae821e3dc6d](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/16SKIuyHDgWqU66USOU2W2/26e1fb7bf1ed5cd8a038eb8125748c62/photo-1478012168135-bae821e3dc6d.jpeg)\n\nAnd remember, passionate ain't perfect. It doesn't mean you have to jump in and solve every problem in the area you care about. It does mean that you have to start somewhere. \n\nOur passion oscillates. It's with us everyday in every strong emotion that we experience - and it means we're alive. So, if something's frustrating or downright pissing you off right now, use it. Don't sleep on your emotions. Give them power.\n\nIf we recognize our strong, beautiful emotions as opportunity to build resilience and to move forward, we can create the change we want to see in the world. \n\n[READ NEXT: How to Journal Yourself Happier](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-journal-yourself-happier/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Passion","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3EUaZKsHOoWqIiqaOy6uYK/d7f04946db0cac856aad2c5663d2a0ee/createherstock-her-isha-gaines-3.JPG","details":{"size":10588284,"image":{"width":6000,"height":4000}},"fileName":"createherstock-her-isha-gaines-3.JPG","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-11-14T01:00"},"author":{"name":"Marah Lidey","bio":"<p>Marah is the cofounder of Shine.</p>\n","picture":{"title":"MarahHeadshot2 (2)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5TpSe4dSxi0iieiYuwoemu/c0435b702e218b3d5ae7048851ecfb1a/MarahHeadshot2__2_.jpg","details":{"size":1467418,"image":{"width":2029,"height":1696}},"fileName":"MarahHeadshot2 (2).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["passion","purpose","fuel","change"]},"description":{"en-US":"Once you find what lights your soul on fire, here's how to chase it."},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"id":"6fJjLBvmJUKWqWO8KcSM2G","urlPath":"articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/"},{"title":{"en-US":"4 Ways To Work Your Professional Network"},"slug":{"en-US":"4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network"},"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>ith an increasing number of digital tools meant to create ‘connections’ at our fingertips today, it is becoming more confusing to navigate the idea of building a professional network. \n\nIs your network...the number of connections you have on LinkedIn? \n\nThe number of professional mentorship groups you belong to? \n\nOr is it, simply, the people you have worked with in your current and past jobs? \n\nConsider Dunbar’s number, which states that the average human being can comfortably maintain stable relationships with 150 people, compared to the average number of LinkedIn connections a person has: 930!

Do you want to learn more about an industry you’re not currently involved in? Learn how to advance your career in your current role? Are you looking to learn how to balance work and life? Answering these questions will help you determine what type of people you need more of in your professional life. \n\n## Set up a coffee with the future you\nIt's easy to believe that the more meetings you have, the more productive you’re being. I’ve found that a more focused approach to building a professional network is far more effective than casting a wide net. \n\nWhen you’re trying to grow your network, build a list of titles you think align with your career growth path. Then, reach out to those around you who have those titles, set up a coffee, and start learn what they do, and how they got to where they are today. \n\n> Setting an intention will help you determine what type of people you need more of in your professional life. \n\n## Focus on quality, not quantity\nThere is definitely such a thing as having too many professional connections. \n\n![21910882333 f0a41db7f1 z](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1Cw9Hc4yOAck4A62CCCoC8/2d7fdfaf64704c06bd8e94db13ac9ade/21910882333_f0a41db7f1_z.jpg)\n\nYour ability to dedicate energy and focus to your relationships decreases with the volume of people you’re trying to connect with. Instead of reaching out to every person in a senior leadership role at your company, focus on building deeper relationships with one or two people you naturally connect with, and whose role you admire. Try to have 10 coffees with 2 people, instead of 2 coffees with 10 people. And don’t force a relationship with someone you don’t naturally connect with, no matter what their title is.\n\n## Make it a two-way street\nBuilding your network isn’t just about getting advice and support - it’s also about giving those things. Often times, when we connect with someone we admire, we forget that the other person wants to be fulfilled by the relationship as well. \n\nI have a ‘friend-tor’ whose career I admire greatly, and who gives me tons of advice. In return, I offer him a fresh perspective on his position as a leader, and give him feedback that people he works with on a daily basis may not be giving him.

Some connections you may form could turn into friendships, while others may become obsolete the further you move along in your path. Maintaining connections is important, but also remember that the purpose of a professional network is to help your career flourish - not to be the most popular young professional in your city. \n\n[READ NEXT: Mind the Gap\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/mind-the-gap/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Farah Sheikh","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fshake\">Farah</a> started her career in advertising at Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York after graduating with a business degree from American University.

Neither of us came from an agency background but we knew what was important from the client’s perspective and that we had something different to offer than what we were seeing in the marketplace. We knew there would be a lot of mistakes along the way and rather than shying away, we faced them head on. \n\n> \"Anyone who has dared greatly, innovated or made things better has also known failure.\"\n\n\nEveryone makes mistakes. We’re only human. But how you learn and grow from them can help you better prepare for challenges ahead. Whether in your personal or professional life, here are a few tips to help you bounce back from a mistake and walk away stronger and smarter.\n\n## RECOGNIZE \nEarly in the life of our agency we took on a project where there were red flags we didn’t pay attention to because we were so eager to prove ourselves as a new entity, even though we had a long track record of success in our careers. \n\nIt was a huge national brand in a category we were dying to break into so while our intuitions were screaming no, our egos kept saying yes. The client was unrealistic but we thought we could turn her around. We couldn’t have been more wrong. In addition to grinding us on every budget and continually asking for new ideas (free of charge) eventually she actually became verbally abusive.  \n\nWe got through the project and delivered but at a cost to ourselves and our team, who were left feeling deflated, unappreciated and exhausted.  \n\n## RECORD \nWe are big believers in intention and writing things down. When we make mistakes we process them by writing down a list of what we learned and would do differently the next time. \n\nThis was crucial to our process of avoiding bad project/client matches in the future. While it may sound intimidating to see your mistake recorded in black and white, it's actually quite liberating. \n\nWhen possible, sharing your list with a friend or partner who can keep you from being too hard or easy on yourself helps to keep the process honest and, therefore, most useful.\n\n## REPAIR \nIf you want to create an environment where people are inspired to be their best, they have to feel safe to fail. If they don’t, they’ll engage in all kinds of unproductive behaviors that only compound the mistake, from covering up to placing blame on others. Meanwhile, time ticks away and the impacts are increased. \n\nEncouraging people to own their mistake and take an active part in the solution means resolution comes quicker and the individual is left with the empowered feeling of having helped to repair it versus the deflation of screwing up, which only makes people feel and think smaller. To repair the damage to our team from the verbally abusive client, we owned up to letting our eagerness override our instinct and shared how we would avoid such situations in the future.\n\n> \"If you want to create an environment where people are inspired to be their best, they have to feel safe to fail.\"\n \n\n## RESOLVE \nOne of the most important parts of recovering from a mistake is knowing when to take a deep breath and let it go. Continually reliving mistakes is unproductive and paralyzing. Once you have done the work to repair the mistake and can clearly articulate your learnings, you should trust you have learned what that mistake has to teach you, freeing you to move on.\n\nThe mindset of recovery and resolution is an important one to build. It allows people to continue to want to take on new challenges and find new ways of doing things-- which, are really powerful assets. A culture that rewards creativity and trying new things – without punishing the misses – fosters a team of savvy problem-solvers who can think on their feet and are energized, instead of paralyzed, by new challenges.\n\nBy: Cassie Hughes & Gabrey Means, Grow Marketing\n\n[READ NEXT: Mind the Gap](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/mind-the-gap/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Create and Cultivate ","bio":"<p>Create &amp; Cultivate is a movement for women looking to create &amp; cultivate the career of their dreams. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"create cultivate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1bTeT49xZOEyusq6cU40kO/447ed90d92c9d0c36bedcebc4cddef30/cc.jpeg","details":{"size":8039,"image":{"width":271,"height":186}},"fileName":"cc.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"Work"},"tags":{"en-US":["failure","mistake","recovery","bounce back"]},"description":{"en-US":"Failure is a part of the flow - here's how to go with it."},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"headerPhoto":{"title":"fail","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2PFefrH0XYW84icgU2Ac2u/d2ab5d6e39072ecd5e10706d691a6baf/fail.jpeg","details":{"size":188701,"image":{"width":940,"height":1410}},"fileName":"fail.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-10-28T07:00"},"id":"6i5IOb2gvuciQEAY6aUkoq","urlPath":"articles/the-4-rs-you-need-to-recover-from-a-mistake/"},{"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>ith the hustle and bustle of life it’s easy to push aside the true importance of a morning routine. Even though waiting until the last second to crawl out of bed and rushing out of the apartment with spilling coffee in one hand while emailing with the other is of the norm it’s not a beneficial way to start the day. \n\nThe basic fundamental is this; you have to set yourself up for success if you are serious about achieving your goals. [Taking care of yourself mentally](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/) is just as important as taking care of yourself physically. If it isn’t already, it should be a priority to start off your day on the best foot possible.\n\nHere are 10 simple adjustments to make to your morning routine that will have a huge impact on your day:\n\n## Go to sleep at the same time each night. \nMaintaining a consistent sleep schedule is the first step in waking up ready to kick ass. I know that it's one of things that is easier said then done, especially when you get sucked into Stranger Things, but getting your body on a sleep schedule is like winning a gold medal. Give your brain the suggested seven to eight hours of sleep to decompress so when you rise you are ready to grind.\n\n## Set your alarm 15 minutes earlier.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-10-18 at 8.40.53 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3hFwZk8IooSgGiaosUaOSo/a88a999d59a8da4c456490fee5d9658b/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.40.53_AM.png)\n\n\n\nGiving yourself the coveted extra 15 minutes in the morning will make you feel like a whole new person. Instead of hitting your alarm and rushing to get out of bed and speed out of the house like a mad person soak up the time to stretch and mentally prepare yourself for the day ahead.\n\n## Ditch the phone. \nI recently set a new rule for myself: I will not check emails + social media until my feet hit the floor in the morning and from my personal experience I can tell you it absolutely changes how I start off my day. I used to lay in bed and before my eye balls were even fully opened I would be multi tasking between double taping a Insta post I missed while dreaming and reading emails that make me want to throw my phone across the room. \n\nSo, before I even got up to brush my teeth the mood of my day would already be set because of someone else. No ma’am, no more of that!  Your morning should be reserved just for you. \n\n> \"Always remember to fall asleep with a dream and wake up with a purpose.\"\n\nDo yourself a favor and before you go to sleep turn off the notifications on your phone so when you wake up and roll over to turn off your alarm you aren’t bombarded by technology before you even realize it’s time to wake up!\n\n## Go all high school on yourself and make your bed.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-10-18 at 8.41.35 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6wa7tYPZeMsAyyyaUYoMoS/d35536f4f0fe02355e34654b58ab50a6/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.41.35_AM.png)\n\nTurns out your mom had a reason behind nagging you every single morning before school. Making your bed helps you get started on a productive path before you even walk out the front door. Starting your day off on the right foot, with a made bed, will put you in gear to check off your to-do list.\n\n## Use a mantra or QOTD.\nReading a motivational quote (oh hey [Shine](https://www.shinetext.com)) every morning can provide a solid framework for the day ahead. Soaking in positive words will motivate you to stay in the right direction and not get detoured by negative thinking.\n\n## Hydrate to motivate.\nI know that drinking coffee is what all the cool kids do but I have news for you, there is something else you should be drinking in the morning. Do yourself a favor and swap out coffee for lemon water. \n\n![Screen Shot 2016-10-18 at 8.41.09 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/41S2OzCEhy2cok4sqK82Gk/b0c409ccf35ac28fd96bd211bd213a15/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.41.09_AM.png)\n\nLukewarm water with fresh squeezed lemon juice has numerous benefits; starts your metabolism, cleanses your mouth and throat and also gives you that extra kick of energy that you may need in the AM. If you’re looking for a dash of daily detox, add a tiny amount of cayenne pepper to the water.\n\n## Give yourself a pep talk.\nSometimes you just have to look yourself in the mirror and give yourself the pep talk,”Hello beautiful. You’re a bad ass babe, you got this. Love you.” I’m not even trying to be funny, you gotta do what you gotta do! The world can be a big bad scary place sometimes so reminding yourself that you got your back isn’t the worst idea.\n\n## Sweat it out.\n\nThere is no denying that starting off your day with a [killer workout](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/my-boss-the-bully-7-steps-for-dealing-with-a-demanding-higher-up/) helps set the mood for the day. \n\nIf you are one of those people (guilty) that can get up and check a workout off the list before the sun rises then all the more power to you. If you prefer to work out after work, no judgements ;) either way, getting a little movement in before breakfast is always a good idea. \n\nSuggestions? A two-minute plank or 20 jumping jacks; whatever gets your blood moving.\n\n## Spread the love.\nWhether you’re kissing your dog, roommate, boyfriend or calling your mom,spreading love provides you with a positive start and keeps you focused on what’s really important, even through the stressful days.\n\n![love dog](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/34KsI6HsHeCmWSwiKwUYCK/07716ac5ec9bc5af991498dab45c13e7/Screen_Shot_2016-10-18_at_8.56.44_AM.png)\n\n\n## Set an intention for the day.\n\nYou don’t want to do all the above just to walk out the door unsure about your next move. What is top priority? What will make you feel most accomplished by the time you lay your head back down on your pillow? What is the one thing you should do today that will get you one step closer to your goal? Whatever those answers are, make it happen. No excuses.\n\n[READ NEXT: How Running Became My Best Therapy\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Morning","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6U0ccBIH6MWQY0gkuqQkU6/bb84c96b1416b5f5e2df3d7a8ed3bb9b/morning.jpeg","details":{"size":1097765,"image":{"width":1500,"height":1000}},"fileName":"morning.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"title":{"en-US":"10 Habits for a Blissful Morning, Every Morning"},"slug":{"en-US":"10-habits-for-a-blissful-morning-every-morning"},"author":{"name":"Create and Cultivate ","bio":"<p>Create &amp; Cultivate is a movement for women looking to create &amp; cultivate the career of their dreams. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"create cultivate","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1bTeT49xZOEyusq6cU40kO/447ed90d92c9d0c36bedcebc4cddef30/cc.jpeg","details":{"size":8039,"image":{"width":271,"height":186}},"fileName":"cc.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-10-18T07:00"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["happiness","morning","habits","wake up"]},"description":{"en-US":"Set your day up for success with a feel-good morning."},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"id":"L0KT2M5xEOQO0yaCKUqus","urlPath":"articles/10-habits-for-a-blissful-morning-every-morning/"},{"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">I</span> can’t believe plans changed!

You had plans and goals to have lost fifteen pounds by the wedding and have a thousand extra bucks in the bank, but somehow it never happened on your time… and you felt like a failure over and over again.\n\n> I did in fact believe, at one point in my life that the sun wouldn't rise unless I set an alarm for it.\n\nYour thoughts are imbalanced. You've come out of balance. You like these unrealistic, unmanageable and chaotic extremes; this all-or-nothing, black-and-white thinking has somehow made you believe that control is entirely yours. \n\nAllow me to remind you, this is a team effort my sweet friend.\n\nRemember, long, long ago, as a child - maybe even before - you seeded your consciousness with the belief that somehow you had complete control of your life. Worse yet, that if you didn't control everything your failure-based thinking was activated, reinforcing the untruth that somehow you aren't enough just the way you are. \n\nI'm so incredibly happy you got sick of feeling the less-than-desirable emotional repercussions of this harsh untruth. That you fell on your face, cried your eyes out and relinquished some of this control. I love you so. Old habits die hard and \n\nI am beyond grateful that you realize you can't orchestrate your perfect, beautiful, sweet life like I can. \n\nMust I remind you sweet friend, are so enough as you are - without having to prove or control anything - so much so that I created the moon and the stars for you to marvel in! \n\n__That is how good enough you are. \n__\n\n![control3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2dJkrkk6e84Ym0I6WUUMac/1f742acd47b7d73d56d90da6166ed622/control3.jpeg)\n\nWhen you feel any form of fear from control - such as worry, anxiety, overwhelm frustration or fear, here's what I want you to do: \n\n## 1. Stop. Breathe. \n\nContinue to cultivate the emotional awareness to know what control feels like in your life. (You can't change a behavior unless you know your behavior.)\n\n## 2. Tap in tune in and turn on to the thoughts upstairs. \n\nYou're only feeling what you're feeling because of what you're thinking. Dig around up there and figure out what the root of the issue may be. \n\n## 3. Gently remind the control-based thought that there is a better way. \n\nUse thought redirection to find a better feeling thought. Try this one on:\n\n*I understand I'm trying to control this situation; it's what I've always done. I also realize that it' not working for me anymore, causing me pain and driving unwanted behaviors. I am choosing to give this situation up to you dear Universe, with all the trust I have right now - however small that may be - that you will create a better outcome than I can. Take it. Thank you. \n*\n## 4. Journal the evidence of perfection. \nYour mind is wired to see what you belief and to keep those beliefs engrained, alive and true. You can shift this by using what you call in psychology confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories. Force yourself to seek all the evidence in your life that trusting me is better than controlling it without me. \n\nThis, my sweet friend will replace old controlling thought patterns with the habit of trust. \n\nAlways remember, you are good enough. You are smart enough. You are beautiful enough. You are more than enough, just the way you are. \n\nI got you,\n\n*The Universe*\n\nSolid advice, that when followed, has proved itself through a calm and peaceful life amidst a chaotic and bossy world. Try it!

We spend endless hours iterating on our own personal producitivty hacks. Yes, I said it. The dreaded “P” word that a lot of us fear most, after the other one – procrastinate. Once we get ourselves into gear, figuring out how to be effectively productive with our workday can be a challenge in a number of ways. \n\nI will admit, having worked in the broadcast and digital media world for major networks for 13 years, then becoming an entrepreneur in 2012, where I was my own boss for the first time, was a major change. \n\nBut once I accepted the new lifestyle and found daily ways to make it work, I started to enjoy being a Girl Boss!

Every evening, I jot down the things I need to get done as well as the things I want to achieve the following day. I find it is extremely helpful to visualize what I need to do, because when I cross it off after completing it, I feel a huge sense of accomplishment. It can be as small as “pay phone bill”, “reply to emails” or even “start proposal document”. \n\nWe all have different “list styles” - pen and paper, Trello, a draft email to ourselves, etc. Whatever your preferred method, the most important thing is you make time to brain dump all of the to-dos that are in your head so that you can set yourself up for success. \n\nFor those of us with full time jobs, it can be a stretch to find time during work hours to do anything except work. But if there is a way to accomplish one non-work-related item each day, by the end of the week you will have crossed 5 things off your list! \n\n![Notebook](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5n1JUlwmc0AOuWAoWQeMqg/5c6f20c8ee195f4c9dd76b7df0372cee/Screen_Shot_2016-10-03_at_8.56.59_PM.png)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for advice on how to live a more productive life delivered straight to your phone.* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\nFor us freelance workers, I find a to-do list can help organize a potentially overwhelming schedule into priorities. It doesn’t have to be a physical pen and paper like mine, it could be one of many amazing apps that are designed to organize our busy lives. \n\n## 2. __Block off dedicated “email reply time”__\n\nI know, it sounds like a no-brainer, but I have been guilty of just letting certain emails go, and before too long I forget they even exist. \n\nWhen you are running a business or working for someone else, your email etiquette is part of your professional “brand”. How quickly you take to reply to emails sends a loud and clear message how committed you are. With inboxes filling up so quickly each day, personally make sure I end each of my work days without any important unread emails related to work. I set time aside each morning to be my “email replying” time before the rest of my day gets going. \n\n![RLC58MRIX8](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2ADphqDS1Kk4kKOoOUyisM/2ca6ce6691d69635c372249880b75ebc/RLC58MRIX8.jpg)\n\nA growing unread number of emails can be very daunting as the day goes on, but you have the power to decide how much demand they have over your life. Be ahead of the email game each day so you don’t have to dread opening your inbox every morning. \n\n## 3. __Know your typical distractors. And nix them!__\nIf you are like me, this means social media! While I have my own business and a self-determined schedule, social media can be a huge drain on my productivity and effectiveness. \n  \nHands up if you have randomly been drawn into a long Facebook conversation or Twitter argument that took a couple of hours out of your day and put you even further behind in your workload? Yep, I am guilty of this! \n\n>  No matter what your Achilles heel of distractors is, it can wait until later.\n\nNo matter what your Achilles heel is, it can wait until later. I have resolved to turning off notifications, not opening a web browser with Facebook, and not watching videos unless they are work related. \n\nOne of the secrets to a high level of productivity is effective time management. My rule of thumb is: unless it absolutely urgent, it can wait for later. Trust me, you will NOT regret the time you forego dealing with distractions in favor of getting more work done. \n\n## 4. __Incorporate self-care into your day__\nEating right, exercising and doing everything you can to remain stress free is super important! That means a decent breakfast each day (not just Starbucks!), taking time to have a lunch break (not just eating in front of your computer!) and getting some fresh air to give your eyes a break from your computer screen or your phone. \n\n> You have the power to decide how much demand email has over your life.\n\nIf you, like me, spend a lot of time at a desk in front of a computer, stretching your hands, giving your eyes a break by looking outside a window (seriously, that counts!) or going for a quick walk around the office or around the block can keep you refreshed and productive throughout your day.  We live in an age of constant digital demand on our time, but ironically, taking time away from that can increase our productivity. Which brings me to my final point. \n\n![photo-1469920783271-4ee08a94d42d](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/24IDHMYEqQ2QqwKqEE4sYA/0bbd2e43800677f516b775fb206ea63b/photo-1469920783271-4ee08a94d42d.jpeg)\n\n## 5. __Take time off (if you can)!__\nTake those vacation days. Choose not to open your laptop or answer emails on your phone over the weekend. Going on vacation is your time to recharge your batteries and come back to workplace motivated and excited. \n\nThis can be tricky, depending on where you work and what your job is. The US is the only developed nation in the world not to have any form of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/15/422957640/lots-of-other-countries-mandate-paid-leave-why-not-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">federally-mandated paid family leave</a>, which can put a huge strain on families, and especially mothers. While there are many companies which do offer it, it is not a standard social institution like it is in, say, Europe. \n\nLikewise, studies show that <a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/trends-stats/the-small-business-owners-guide-to-taking-a-vacation/#sm.000006sg95mwipfabu8uhi66azomp\" target=\"_blank\">people who take a vacation</a> regularly report higher levels of productivity. A happy worker means a profitable company and satisfied customers. \n\nIt has become too easy to expect employees to be “on call” 24/7 because we are so attached to our phones and digital devices, but that shouldn’t negate the fact that we deserve a break. <a href=\"http://www.today.com/money/french-law-makes-weekend-work-emails-illegal-grants-right-disconnect-t94886\" target=\"_blank\">France recently passed a law</a> stating employers could not email their employees during the weekend, and I don’t know about you, but that sounds like the right idea! \n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you into a basic productivity pattern that is easy and effective to maintain - and can get you some of your downtime back. \n\nWhat are your favorite productivity hacks?

This phrase has been a mantra for the majority of my life. When I am at my best, I can be adaptable, spontaneous, and free-spirited. At my worst, I am a relentless people pleaser.\n\nIn my work as a counselor, few clients come to me with the primary goal of working on their people pleasing. And yet, I see its fingerprints on the lives of nearly every woman I work with. On the surface, it often presents itself as a fog of <a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/\" target=_\"blank\">emotional fatigue</a> resulting from the constant work of balancing the needs, wants, and expectations of others. It fuels many struggles with depression and anxiety. It colors relationships with underlying bitterness and resentment.\n\nAt its core, __people pleasing is rooted in fear. __\n\nWe worry about how our choices might impact or inconvenience others. Instead of asking the people in our lives for what we need and desire, we say no for them. We find ourselves settling for a role as a background character in others’ stories because we’re scared — often for good reason — to show up in our own.\n\nMy people pleasing journey began early. \n\nLike many young children of divorce, I entered elementary school with an extra dose of insecurity. To top it off, I was a super sensitive kid who did not cope well with even the mildest disapproval or casual mistake. Classrooms and playgrounds provided the perfect environment for me to hone the skill of perception management to avoid that stinging shame.\n\n> \"We find ourselves settling for a role as a background character in others’ stories because we’re scared.\"\n\nToday, my husband has most often been the recipient of my people pleasing efforts — which has only intensified since becoming parents. He works hard, is a wonderful, attentive father to our two little boys, and carries a big chunk of the household duties which keep our world functional.\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-29 at 8.54.43 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1Fsxdl8sreOSgw8UYAOeuy/dc050f2b01c93c95cf28bf6696b9ce07/Screen_Shot_2016-09-29_at_8.54.43_AM.png)\n\nWhen he checks in with me about doing things during a morning, evening, or weekend — going for a run, meeting up with some guy friends, getting some extra work done — I almost always say yes. No problem. I’m good with whatever.\n\nThroughout the decade we’ve been married, I’ve begun to notice a pattern. It most often begins with feeling <a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-diffuse-everyday-anxiety/\" target=_\"blank\">anxious and overwhelmed</a> by the “Have-Tos” of life. I then respond by checking out emotionally when it all just feels like too much. This typically follows with passive-aggressive behavior, complaining, and — every once in a while —rounds out with a nice, tear-filled breakdown in which I spew blame upon my poor husband.\n\nWe recently had a conversation in which I bemoaned the lack of relational connection in my life. As I processed this, I found myself saying, I would have more time for friends in my life if YOU didn’t spend all of our free time running, working, and spending time with your friends.\n\nThe second these words escaped my mouth, I knew just how wrong I was. It wasn’t his fault. I was bitter that __he had the courage and the forethought to ask for what he needed and wanted and I didn’t__.\n\nWhat I discovered was this — my knee-jerk yeses and whatevers often become excuses to not take ownership of my own life. Managing the expectations and anticipating the needs of others is a full-time job that has robbed me of a full life and meaningful relationships. It’s too high a price to pay.\n\n> \"Managing the expectations and anticipating the needs of others is a full-time job.\"\n\nI also have learned that self-care isn’t enough. \n\nWhile I’m all for a good bubble bath and glass of wine, I think what we people pleasers need most is a supportive shove. We need people in our lives who will cheer us on as we commit ourselves to some of those things we always say we’d do if we had more time. \n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-29 at 8.58.14 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2d7JpUJRhKI0ssuMS0UWa2/e748d6092483a77cb3f7871ec44284e3/Screen_Shot_2016-09-29_at_8.58.14_AM.png)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](https://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living you best life via text* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nWe need to be held accountable to making space for those dreams that perpetually remain on the back burner.

Not only does it put you in a position to be more successful, but it also it keeps you feeling energized when you're working within your talents.\n\nFrom work, to interpersonal relationships, to creative hobbies, playing to your strengths is a great tactic for success.\n\nOn the flip side, however, dismissing your weaknesses can hold you back. \n\nHow many times have you ever muttered the words, “I’m just not good at that.” Whether it was spreadsheets, entrepreneurship, painting, surfing, or public speaking, assuming that you’re not good at something and therefore staying away from it is a recipe for dissatisfaction. \n\n> Believing that your talents, skills, and competencies are static is a huge lie you’re telling yourself. <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/Y6PH5\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\nAccording to renowned Stanford Psychology Professor <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Dweck</a>, the most successful people in life believe that everything develops and grows.

Getting into action on new skills helps build self-efficacy and creates new opportunities for you across the board. \n\nTo harness a growth-mindset and improve your confidence start here:\n\n## Identify where you feel your skills are innate or predetermined\n\nWhere are you staying on the sidelines of your life? What things do you feel drawn towards but have convinced yourself that you’re just not good at?\n\nIdentifying these competencies is the first step in creating an action plan to improve them. Try listing out all the things you’ve ever assumed that you’re not good at. Circle the one or two you wish you were better at. And voila, you have a skill worth putting your energy toward.\n\n## Measure effort and improvement\nNo one wakes up as the best gymnast in the world. Nor do they become an amazing public speaker just by breathing. Anyone who is great at something has dedicated time and energy towards it. \n\nEverything about you can and will get better with effort. If you track and measure where you started and how you progress, you’ll be fueled with more encouragement to keep going when you see the positive outcomes. \n\n## Know it’s Always a Stretch and Act Anyways\nAnyone who does something that they don’t feel strong at feels the discomfort of a stretch. The greats? They do it anyways. They level up. The feel the stretch and keep going for it. \n\n> Anyone who is great at something has dedicated time and energy towards it. <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/d7IGq\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42\" alt=\"Tweet \"></a>\n\nHaving a growth-mindset keeps you moving toward that stretch instead of away from it. Stretching is key to knowing that eventually you’ll be able to reach the new level you so desire. \n\nRemember these four tips whenever you find yourself “convinced” that you’re bad at something.  Harnessing a growth mindset will remind you that you’re not bad, you’re just inexperienced and being hard on yourself.  \n\nIf there's something you really want to experience, master, or create... don't let a few shoddy attempts discourage you. Because you're not static. You're not stagnant. You're not still. You're not bad at it. You're just not far enough in to have gotten good. Fiercely believe that you can, and you will. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\n[READ NEXT: 3 Ways to Take Back Your Confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"The Big Lie Killing Your Confidence"},"slug":{"en-US":"the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence"},"author":{"name":"Maxie McCoy","bio":"<p>Maxie McCoy is a writer and speaker obsessed with giving women the tools they need to believe in themselves.

My body ached, like I hadn’t stopped moving for years. I felt deprived of motivation and energy to get up out of bed. I reached for my phone on my nightstand and Googled the word ‘burnout.’\n\nBurnout, a psychological term that refers to long-term exhaustion and diminished interest in work. Burnout, the result of chronic occupational stress. The American Psychological Association studies stress in the United States.\n\nAccording to its <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2015-SiA-Snapshot-06.png\" target=\"_blank\">2015 study</a>, stress  levels in the United States have seen a slight increase in the past two years and <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2015-SiA-Snapshot-01b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Millennials are the most stressed out</a> generation in the United States. The study also suggests that regardless of gender, both men and women rate money and work as significant sources of stress.\n\nI accepted my burnout in the summer of 2013 and experienced my first recovery process at that time. It was pretty intense. \n\n> I can stay in my “Happy Place” when I allow myself the space and time to stop and recover\n\nSince that time, whenever I feel myself getting close to my burnout line, I stop what I’m doing to recharge immediately. It’s much easier to stay in the magical flow of life and in my “Happy Place” when I allow myself the space and time to stop and recover.  \n\nHere are my Top 10 favorite burnout recovery tips!\n\n1. __Meditate:__ \n  Sit in a quiet room for 20 minutes and focus on your breathing. Meditation is known to reduce anxiety. Researches studied the effects that meditation has on anxiety in a report that was published in the 2013 edition of Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. The study shows that meditation reduced anxiety ratings by as much as 39 percent.  \n\n2. __Communicate:__\n  It helps to connect. Old friends are like corner puzzle pieces. Find them. Catch up and let them know how they can support you through this time. \n\n3. __Write:__\n  Writing can be used as a way to release all the emotions you’re experiencing right now. Make a list of everything you’re burdened by. Can you connect the burden to the emotion? This will help you identify what in your life you should examine more closely at a later time. Put the list away and revisit suggestion 1 – 4.  \n\n  ![write](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4be56Do0lq6gYUcYIQ4gUk/d745c1718e3ddcd57e825753719dd275/write2.jpeg)\n\n4. __Take a dip:__ \n  If you can, opt for a swim the ocean. Let the tide carry away every tired cell within your body. Let the healing properties of the salt water lift your energy. If you can’t get near an ocean, go buy sea salt at the grocery store. Put a cup of sea salt in the bath tub and sit in it for 15 minutes. \n\n5. __Move:__ \n  The Anxiety and Depression Association of America states that even five minutes of aerobic exercise can elevate and stabilize moods and decrease overall levels of tension and stress. Turn on Justin Timberlake and Dance Dance Dance around your living room to increase your mood! \n  \n  ![4S23GF9HGW](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1dL6ll5sfWEWEIqY4ciuiS/25bdece098fbde5779e39c94a3f6d248/4S23GF9HGW.jpg)\n  \n  ---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com)for more tips to help you live your best life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n6. __Power Down:__ \n  Turn off all electronics for as many hours as you can and watch old comedies that make you laugh uncontrollably. By disengaging from technology, we reprogram our habits and create boundaries with our work. \n\n7. __Laugh:__ \n  If turning off your tablet or phone is too uncomfortable for you at first, watch YouTube videos that has nothing to do with your day job. Laughter is honestly one of the best remedies. It can lead to crying, which is also really good for you! Let your body laugh until you cry! \n\n8. __Play:__ \n  We’re told to go outside and play as kids. Playing increases our mood, brain function, reduces our stress and shifts our moods. Head to your nearest amusement park and get yourself a ticket! Tap into your inner child and remember what it felt like to not work so hard! \n  \n  ![Play](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1NqqVxt5XGwy24uIYwUsgi/252bfd71c153271631617f43b961251a/26LKVXD9VT.jpg)\n\n9. __Try Essential Oils:__ \n  I became a huge fan of essential oils during my burnout phase. Lavender is my favorite for stress reduction. Dabble a few drops of lavender on your wrists and let your body rest. Essential oils have increased in popularity with companies like doTerra and Young Living. There are many health benefits to using oils.

I’d never run before. \n\nI’m not particularly athletic. \n\nI’m still not sure why I decided to go for a run, having never done it before. But I needed an excuse to escape the tiny new dorm I was sharing with a stranger, and that night, running seemed like a better idea than sitting alone at the campus dining hall. And it was, shin splints and all.\n\n![School](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3KqFZX83m0CCOiyII6kCi4/b635f7db3b7e9745cb06b2c9e5879bfc/BB76EYQM84.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com)for more advice to help you live your best life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nThroughout college, when things felt overwhelming, I’d go for a run. When I needed a study break. When I needed an escape from the dorm. When I was sad or tired or stressed. I never really paid attention to pace or distance. It was more about turning up music and tuning out everything around me.\n\nJunior year, it became hard for me to do anything—raise my hand in class, walk across campus, study at the library—without falling into a full-on panic. It’s confusing to be 21 and too nervous to walk into a lecture hall, let alone a frat party. I found a psychologist, who suggested therapy and medication; both helped, but it was upping my mileage that actually made me feel better.\n\nRunning can't solve everything, and running too much can make everything even worse (which is another lesson I learned the hard way when I tried to train for a half marathon without doing my research). \n\nBut even the experts agree that exercise—and running, specifically—is as beneficial for your mental well-being as your body. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/\" target=\"blank\">Aerobic exercise not only relieves depressive symptoms</a>, but also, when <a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/how-running-and-meditation-change-the-brains-of-the-depressed.html\" target=\"_blank\">combined with meditation</a>, it can actually change your entire brain for the better.\n\n> Therapy and medication helped, but it was upping my mileage that actually made me feel better.\n\nI don’t know how much my brain has actually changed, but I don’t need science to tell me these benefits exist—because I’ve experienced them firsthand.\n\n__When I first moved to New York, it was like that first day of college all over again. __This time, it was me and 8.4 million strangers in a neighborhood I hadn’t spent a single day in. \n\n![NYC](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5t6W43pEg8uwEoIGi6Uk4q/c8d3edbdf036fc7f41395d3f13d8ea50/94356BMTJ5.jpg)\n\nEvery night after work—before I made new friends and when my social life was limited to talking to my college pals on the phone—I’d run, getting less and less lost every night. When I did make friends (and when I finally stopped getting so lost), I’d run in the morning.\n\nSometimes the anxiety from college would come back (it always does, doesn’t it?). When it was really bad, it’d feel pretty impossible to drag myself outside to go for a run in the daylight—because nothing about anxiety is rational. So I’d run late at night.\n\nRunning helped me work through brutal anxiety, bad relationships, terrible bosses, and also lots of really great things, too, like quitting my job and taking a risk on an idea I believe in. I still have so much nervous energy that sometimes it feels I might actually spontaneously combust. But that’s why I’m never too far from my running shoes.\n\n[READ NEXT: 4 Ways To Diffuse Everyday Anxiety](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-diffuse-everyday-anxiety/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Runner","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2PesKLPTHaekSgeEu08yak/a05232372b0597cb440144725c08e8c1/runner.jpeg","details":{"size":20350123,"image":{"width":5384,"height":3376}},"fileName":"runner.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"title":{"en-US":"How Running Became My Best Therapy"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-running-became-my-best-therapy"},"date":{"en-US":"2016-09-21T10:00"},"author":{"name":"Casey Lewis","bio":"<p>Casey Lewis is a writer and along with Liza Darwin is the cofounder of <a href=\"http://www.cloverletter.com/\">Clover Letter</a>, a newsletter that delivers inspiring, empowering, and actually-relevant news—straight to your phone. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"Casey Lewis","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4hKLUt768gCsCk0qAyWG88/fe46ae946e4d65e994c7e5dea881a73e/casey.jpeg","details":{"size":7034,"image":{"width":225,"height":225}},"fileName":"casey.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"category":{"en-US":"life"},"tags":{"en-US":["exercise ","therapy","running","anxiety","relief "]},"description":{"en-US":"Running isn't always about getting jacked calves.

My friends, family, and interviewers all know it as my biggest weakness. I have trouble saying no, which has resulted in some great opportunities... and also some not so great experiences. \n\nIf you’re anything like me, you know it’s easy to overcommit, but extremely difficult to [balance](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-sober-up-from-your-busy-ness-addiction/) such a full schedule. \n\nThough I haven’t quite learned how to say no yet, I have learned how to \nmanage all of my responsibilities, which can be summarized in 5 tips below:\n\n## 1. Commit to causes you actually like.\nAt the moment, I have five jobs. Yes, five. This wasn’t unplanned, nor do I work 100 hour weeks. I absolutely love each job and have been learning completely different skills at each one. Though having one, full-time job is more customary, it’s just not for me. I enjoy exploring different areas and learning more about myself through things that I am passionate about. Curt Rosengren summarizes the benefits of loving your work, citing increased energy and [confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/) as benefits of being passionate about your job.\n\n## 2. Be transparent about busyness. \nA heavy workload can work - if you are upfront with friends, family, and people you work with. \n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-15 at 11.24.20 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1aOUMVPtV60kSqOW2u86wM/fadc29884089f8944d7125a59bacff13/Screen_Shot_2016-09-15_at_11.24.20_AM.png)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com)for more life hacks.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nBy letting others know you have a lot on your plate, you can best allocate the time you do have to work on a specific task. Those around you will be able to understand the type of efficiency you work with, and you will be able to be more productive during the time you allot for each task. \n\n## 3. Don’t allow other commitments to be distractions.\nIt is very tempting to work on several things at the same time. Your day at job #1 could be going a little slow, so you pull up a project you have been working on for job #2. Not a good idea. \n\n> A heavy workload can work - if you are upfront with friends, family, and people you work with.\n\nThis distraction puts you at a lower focus for job #1, and your coworkers can start to view you as a slacker. Whenever doing any type of work, focus 100% on that task. The work you produce will be higher quality and result in higher satisfaction from others. \n\n## 4. Quality always trumps quantity. \nThe only thing worse than having 143 things to do is having someone on your team who is always late or missing deadlines. If your involvement is starting to take a toll on the quality of your work or your commitment to a team, take a step back. \n\nIt is always better to be delivering [your best self](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/) to a project or task, rather than a flustered and busy you. Those around you will notice when there is too much on your plate. Maintain the self awareness to know when it’s too much.\n\n## 5. Organization, serious organization. \nWhen you have multiple deadlines or several places to be, it can be difficult to remember where you’re supposed to be or what you’re supposed to be doing. \n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-15 at 11.24.01 AM](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1KQ4W3MqfegcASIYc2WQuQ/96c2b9d6a0d880c8a614405da216a6c1/Screen_Shot_2016-09-15_at_11.24.01_AM.png)\n\nHelp [your busy self](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-sober-up-from-your-busy-ness-addiction/) out and put events and deadlines on a calendar (and set alerts!), make to do lists, and schedule things like grocery shopping, seeing friends, and going to the gym. You may have a lot of commitments, but there’s no reason to sacrifice your quality of life. Planning and being organized will allow you to maintain productivity while also avoiding copious amounts of stress.\n\nThe over-committed life is not for everyone. Having a lot of responsibilities is often stressful and can leave little you-time. If you’re luckier than I am, you’ve probably figured out how to successfully say no. \n\nIf you’re in the same boat as me, take a deep breath and remember that having so many responsibilities is a blessing that most don’t have, and people like us might just be taking advantage of this wonderful world that we live in. \n\n<br>\n\n ### <center> [Read More Shine Articles](http://advice.shinetext.com/)</center>\n \n[ READ NEXT: 3 Steps to Becoming Wisely Selfish](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-steps-to-becoming-wisely-selfish/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"5 Life Hacks For the Overcommitted"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-tips-for-the-overcommitted"},"tags":{"en-US":["busy","work","balance","juggle","organization"]},"description":{"en-US":"Are you the type of person who likes juggling jobs, side-projects, hobbies and an active social life?

It's a playground to create what we want and should allow us to experience massive amounts of joy and peace. \n\n> Peace isn’t something you find one day and never struggle to hold onto.\n\nShould you find you have a task to complete or a new goal to achieve, find the path of least resistance. If one way of achieving it is met with massive resistance, stop, and be open to another way, one that feels better to you.\nThis one practice alone can be instantly calming.\n\n## Train your muscles for relaxation.\n\nSystematic muscle relaxation training is a strategy used in <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/in-depth-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/\" target=\"_blank\">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT) to reduce anxiety. \n  \nYou can do this on your own  - very simply - by choosing a specific muscle, or set of muscles, (such as your upper legs, abdomen or neck muscles) and purposefully tensing them for seven seconds followed by purposeful relaxation of them for fifteen seconds. \n\nOnline <a href=\"http://www.artofliving.org/us-en/online-guided-meditation\" target=\"_blank\">guided meditations</a> with muscle relaxation are a great tool for this. \n\n## Schedule ‘worry time.’\n  \nScheduling in ‘worry time’ is a classic intervention in CBT used to help you gain control over anxiety and worry. \n  \n![write](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6JO4bhFOHSsEYQIMyeSScQ/d905a02975a5bd3caedebe26e56098fc/write.jpeg)\n\n__Here’s how it works: __\n\nFind a quiet space all to yourself. Set a timer, for no longer than 45 minutes (less is better) to journal and think rationally about the anxiety-producing thoughts. Two extremely helpful questions I use with clients in my practice are: \n\n*How can I see this differently?*  \n\n*How can I feel better about this?*\n\nAfter your timer goes off, ‘worry time’ is over. End your session with a meditation or muscle relaxation. When fear, worry or anxiety creeps in - outside of ‘worry time’, try to  ‘save it’ for your next scheduled session. \n\n## Don’t get caught in the fear storm.\n\n__Fear storms:__ when your deepest worries come to life. \n\n<a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/\" target=\"_blank\">Fear is all-encompassing</a>. Anxiety takes over. You create problems that aren’t really there. You find new levels of pain, overwhelm and frustration to exist in.\n\n![Fear storm](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/555pNud9SU8mMoQYMw8AMO/66caef3a0145c253d261f6bd90e716a5/Screen_Shot_2016-09-14_at_8.47.41_AM.png)\n\nI've learned there is a quiet and calm eye to the storm, waiting for us all along. You can find this place by recognizing when in your thoughts are spiralling out of control and attempting to loosen your grip on those thought patterns. Whether it’s through finding a positive distraction, reciting affirmations or by recognizing that you cannot solve the problem in this very moment - consciously pulling yourself out of the storm is often the fastest way to calm your nerves. \n\nPeace isn’t something you find one day and never struggle to hold onto. It is every day work and it is challenging. The good news? We are all capable and deserving of it. \n\nCheers to finding your peace!\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Simple Ways to Lighten Up When Things Feel Heavy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Maya Nahra","bio":"<p>Maya is a behavioral dietitian for frustrated, yo-yo dieters (people who already know what to do but just aren&#39;t doing it).

Models aren’t spared from this pressure, either. British model <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/charlihoward\" target=_\"blank\">Charli Howard</a> spoke out against her agency last year when they told her she was “too big” (nevermind the fact that she’s 5’8” and wears a size 2 or 4).  \n\nIn the open letter on (where else?) social media, she said “I will no longer allow you to dictate to me what's wrong with my looks and what I need to change in order to be \"beautiful\" (like losing one f****** inch off my hips), in the hope it might force you to find me work.” \n\n> “We've all been taught this mentality of comparison, especially when it comes to our looks, so when all we see around us are Photoshopped, unattainable 'ideal' bodies, our self esteem is doomed.\"\n\nAlong with being a total badass role model, Charli took back the dialogue and is all the better for it. “I instead choose to focus on the nicer comments, and put the not-so-nice ones to the back of my mind,” she said. “Whenever I'm feeling down, I always remember how grateful I am to not be that sad person leaving mean comments on people's pictures in order to make myself feel better!”\n\nObsessing over someone else’s pictures won’t make you feel any better about your own. [Social media has incredible power](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/on-this-day-4-ways-your-past-can-motivate-present-you/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), and it’s up to us to harness it. “I also think that, despite what the majority of people think, platforms like Instagram can be used to empower girls and to spread positivity, and if you look for good things, you will find them on there,” Charli said. \n\nJust take it from Chloe Lee, a 17-year-old from Chicago, who summed it up best. “We can't change or control people who post these Photoshopped photos, but we can change our attitude and response. Our generation often gets swayed by social media—maybe it's our job to change this?”\n\n*This article was originally published in [Clover Letter](https://cloverletter.com), a daily newsletter.*\n\n[READ NEXT: The Big Lie Killing Your Confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":"Advice on maintaining confidence between all the likes and selfies."},"headerPhoto":{"title":"socialmedia","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5BMK8Lifi8SWs2YgWc2uoo/bca4266dc2008a1993117e16718502bf/socialmedia.jpeg","details":{"size":6729160,"image":{"width":4499,"height":2441}},"fileName":"socialmedia.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Liza Darwin","bio":"<p>Liza Darwin is a writer and along with Casey Lewis is the cofounder of <a href=\"http://www.cloverletter.com/\">Clover Letter</a>, delivers inspiring, empowering, and actually-relevant news—straight to your phone. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"lizad","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5GMkVxa2zeyeqmykgkI6Gg/0a63f48b093ee9217b1718f0c13b221a/lizad.jpg","details":{"size":9740,"image":{"width":178,"height":178}},"fileName":"lizad.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-09-12T08:00"},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["social media","selfie","confidence","happiness","body positivity"]},"id":"cpC97y6uvmmQAgQoogUOo","urlPath":"articles/how-social-media-can-boost-your-confidence/"},{"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">C</span>onfidence: a feeling of self-assurance arising from the appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.

I’m good at math. I’m good at ____ (fill in the blank).\n\nThis insinuates that we’re born with a specific talent, and moreover we need to prove this skill, ability or success to others and to ourselves. In this scenario we compare ourselves to others, and this becomes the benchmark for our accomplishments. \n\n__The result? __\n\nStress, insecurity, negativity. We become less solution-oriented and less likely to succeed because we start to believe we can’t do something. There will always be someone who is more successful than us. So the “be good” mindset can only get us so far. \n\nThe “get better” mindset, on the other hand, is all about improving versus proving and <a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/\">comparing ourselves to ourselves</a>. \n\n> We become less solution-oriented and less likely to succeed because we start to believe we can’t do something.\n\nFor example, if you’ve been trying to figure out what to do with your life and career, stop comparing yourself to your colleague or best friend who landed a management role at the age of 24. You have no idea what her path is about, where she’ll stumble, and if she’ll even stay the course.\n\nInstead track your own progress. Where were you one year ago?\n\n1. __How were you feeling then?__ How are you feeling now?\n\n2. __What were you doing then?__ And what are you doing now? What path are you on?\n\n3. __Are you learning?__ How are you evolving? \n\nWhen you track your own progress, you can see how and where you’re growing. Use that as motivation to keep pushing forward, to feel proud of your accomplishments. \n\nIf you’re not progressing, don’t despair. This newfound self awareness can lead you to course correct now.  \n\n## Step 1: Journal It\n\nThe Five Minute Journal is another tool that can help you improve your confidence in moments of stress or anxiety. \n\n![journal](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/377KwbaLpKQ8am0amGAAo8/3d5a56f0239809b1205adf26b447194d/journal.jpg)\n\nThe idea is rooted in the <a href\"http://thehustle.co/the-five-minute-journal-will-make-you-happier\" target=\"_blank\">psychology and power of gratitude</a>, and the journaling is pretty straightforward and simple. \n\n__Each day contains five simple questions. __\n\nWhat are you grateful for?\nWhat would make today great?\nWhat is your daily affirmation?\nWhat are three amazing things that happened today?\nHow could I have made today even better?\n\nYou answer three in the morning and two in the evening. \n\nThe goal is to set your day with intention and approach your day with greater positivity. Feeling down? Set the intention to do something that boosts your mood. In the evening, see how you’re feeling. What did you accomplish?\n\n## Step 2: Talk About It\n\nWhen I was 24, the quarter-life crisis hit me hard. I felt lost in both my professional and personal life. \n\nI’d had amazing, life-changing experiences in college, but once I graduated and hit the professional world, I found life wasn’t as I’d expected.\n\nI was also struggling personally, wrestling with big questions around marriage and relationships, unsure of how I wanted to live my life. \n\nI didn’t talk about any of this. I held it in. I felt ashamed because I thought if I’m having all of these struggles, I obviously don’t have my shit together. I’m a failure. \n\n![JNAAU88O7N](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1ICTziNQX2E8K42G6EyS8K/2173ec98d20ac61197570e72b7fdc5d1/JNAAU88O7N.jpg)\n\nAnxiety and <a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much/\">fear of judgement</a> took over. And I continued not to talk about it. As a result, I spent a lot of time in my head. I wasn’t finding a solution because I wasn’t talking about the problem.\n\nWhenever you hit a roadblock, especially if you’re struggling with confidence, talk about it. You give the fear, the insecurity, the anxiety less power. \n\nFind a trusted friend or join a community that empowers you. You’ll start to find solutions and inspiration, which will keep you moving. \n\n## Step 3: Just Keep Moving Forward\n\nThere are times when our confidence takes a toll, especially when we’re taking risks and not following a set path. Afterall, when you follow a set path, you have a point of comparison. There’s data that things have worked out for others so they’ll likely work out for you. But this is bullshit.\n\nTake comfort in the fact that you’re <a href=\"http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-hidden-power-of-trusting-your-gut-no-matter-what/\">following your gut</a>. By taking this risk, you’re finding new solutions, you’re being creative. All of this should empower you to keep going. \n\nSomeone also shared with me this image during a recent moment of struggle.\n\n![quote](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3DGUIfOmjeYGUQwIAw0Aki/57888ce054262ac6ea2daf3dfd622c4f/quote.jpg)\n\nI refer to it often when I’m living in the doubt. \n\n[READ NEXT: The Big Lie Killing Your Confidence\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-big-lie-killing-your-confidence/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"3 Ways to Take Back Your Confidence "},"slug":{"en-US":"3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence"},"date":{"en-US":"2016-09-08T09:00"},"author":{"name":"Belma McCaffrey","bio":"<p>Belma McCaffrey is a writer, mentor and the founder of <a href=\"https://www.belmamccaffrey.com/workbiggerschool/\">Work Bigger</a>, a mentorship program and community empowering 20 to 30-somethings to get more focused, be more decisive and get big things done.

How to Leverage Your Energy Style"},"slug":{"en-US":null},"body":{"en-US":"<span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hat is introversion and extraversion all about? And, more importantly, how can it help you? Here are tips to get to the root of these popular buzzwords and some actionable advice on leveraging your type.\n\n# Defining introversion and extraversion.\nFirst, let’s ditch the misconception that extraverts are social butterflies and introverts are wallflowers. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist who coined these terms, knows best, and defines them in terms of stimulation --\n\n> The key to finding your style and creating your optimal flow - is understanding where you gain the most energy. \n\nIntroverts gain energy from their inner world, which is made of ideas, emotions, and memories. They feel truly alive when reading, writing, thinking, and researching.  A third to half of the workforce is introverted, whether they appear that way or not. \n\nExtraverts are energized by the outer world, which is made of people, experience, and activity. They are enlivened when engaging externally and taking action.\n\nBottom line, introversion and extraversion are about the energy you gain from stimulation in either your inner  or outer world.\n\n# Self-assess your type.\nYou might be wondering, “I like spending time in both worlds. How do I know which one I prefer?” Truth. We all alternate between the inner and outer world, back and forth, each day. \n\nThe key to finding your style and creating your optimal flow - is understanding where you gain the most energy. \n\nIf you’re still unsure, consider logging activities that serve as particularly energizing or draining for seven days. (You may see a pattern that certain job responsibilities or people in your life are draining. That’s valuable information, but for a separate post.) \n\n> \"The key to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in a zone of stimulation that is right for us.\" - Susan Cain\n\nTune in to activities that take you from a baseline level of energy to pure invigoration, and note whether they fall in your inner or outer world. Commit to paying close attention for the full period, and you’ll find more focus and energy in one of these worlds over the other.\n\nNow that you have a sense of where you gain energy from, leverage it! \n\n## Introverts: advocate for your inner world.\n\n![introvert](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4qshXUpLRuk0S6akcc8ac6/1ab6c5153f067831715b93db11437194/introvert.jpeg)\n\n### __Let others know you’ll revert after you reflect on an idea.__ \nWhether your boss wants to brainstorm ideas in real-time or an intern asks for on-the-spot feedback, give yourself space to reflect by letting them know you’ll get back to them later. \n\n### __Designate private spaces and times where you can escape to collect your thoughts.__\nFind the secret conference room that no one ever uses. Wear noise-cancelling headphones. Block off nights for yourself or for some one-on-one time with a friend or partner at home. Allow yourself to dive into your inner world without interruptions.\n\n### __Opt to communicate in writing.__\nIt’s OK if meetings aren’t your jam for selling your big ideas. Capture peak clarity and energy from your inner world by writing memos or emails, even if the situation doesn’t necessarily call for it. Use writing as a support tool when you present your thoughts to others.\n\n## Extraverts: create opportunities in the outer world. \n\n![extravert](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6b84qujXTU4qUYK80wcqSG/5ba2684c862bb6c5438514b768a6e717/extravert.jpg)\n\n### __Take conversations offline.__\nWhen your email exchange with a coworker feels endless, embrace the urge to pick up the phone or chat in person. The answer may lie in a quick chat in the office or coffee run, and you’ll be energized by the interaction. \n\n### __Work out ideas by talking them through.__\nIdentify a like-minded confidant to regularly generate and bounce around ideas. You’ll go further faster with this approach.\n\n### __Position yourself to interact and engage with others.__\nTake your weekend work to a bustling cafe instead of an empty office. Get off the treadmill and into a running club. Find opportunities to physically put yourself in more stimulating environments. \n\nIt is also important to note that knowing your communication and energy style is not about putting yourself in a box. Plenty of folks recognize themselves as largely belonging to one end of the spectrum or the other, and over time develop the comfort and fluency to step out of their characteristic mode.\n\n> Communication and energy style is not about putting yourself in a box.\n\nAs Susan Cain said in one of the most popular TED Talks of all time, “the key to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in a zone of stimulation that is right for us.” Whether you consider yourself more of an introvert or extravert, actively identify and seek out situations that play to your type.\n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Your 'Me-Time' Back\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"introvert2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3LAtXrcUIEYSYQ0oWGaWI/33b4e175651e08742528be7d31c562ef/introvert2.jpeg","details":{"size":294917,"image":{"width":1080,"height":720}},"fileName":"introvert2.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-09-07T11:00"},"author":{"name":"Hana Ayoub","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.HanaAyoub.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hana Ayoub</a> is a professional development coach for high achievers who want to align their priorities in pursuit of dynamic success.

I have a full schedule and a never ending to- do list. Even though I love my life and am passionate about my many projects, having so many demands on my time, energy and attention can be stressful and overwhelming at times. To maintain a sense of calm and well-being, I have a few daily self-care practices that include meditation and disconnecting from technology.\n\nOne of my favorite practices is spending time each night reviewing my day and doing a self-check-in. This check-in, which includes an inventory of my predominant thoughts and feelings, has become a great awareness building tool. \n\nI discovered one of the biggest culprits causing me stress were my ‘should’ thoughts.  The tape that played in my head was repeating phrases like I should exercise more, I should go to that networking event, I should make that phone call, I should volunteer …\n\n> Training your brain to be positive is not so different from training your muscles at the gym.\n\nAll these ‘shoulds’ were creating feelings of being overwhelmed and literally sucking the joy and happiness out of my life. I had experienced [burnout](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-ways-to-bounce-back-from-burnout/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) and depression in my twenties and it was not a place I was willing to revisit.\n\nMany of us know we should take care of our physical bodies –  that we [need to exercise](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-Ways-Fitness-Can-Transform-Your-Mental-Health/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) and eat healthy. But how many of us devote the same attention and care to our thoughts and emotions?  \n\nIn his article <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/01/positive-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">Positive Intelligence</a> Shawn Achor, the bestselling author of The Happiness Advantage, says “training your brain to be positive is not so different from training your muscles at the gym. Research in neuroplasticity… reveals that as you develop new habits, you rewire the brain.” \n\nSo I set myself free and changed my thoughts by eliminating ‘should’ from my vocabulary. Now I am on a mission to help others do the same so they can reduce their stress and regain their enthusiasm.\n\n> The tape that played in my head was repeating phrases like I should exercise more, I should go to that networking event, I should make that phone call, I should volunteer …\n\nIf you are ready to add more positivity, joy and gratitude to your life, follow the eight principles of the ‘should’ elimination diet:\n\n# Is it really a ‘should’? \nYes, some things in life you need to do. \n\nYou need to feed yourself but do you need to go to a friend’s party? If it feels more like an obligation or if you are afraid you will upset your friend, it is not something you ‘need’ to do. Take care of yourself and remember self-care is not selfish.\n\n# Is it a positive ‘should’?\nA positive should is something like, ‘I should try scuba diving’ assuming diving is something you really want to do. If you use the word should, it will most likely be something you will only contemplate and not something you will actually ever do. \n\n![Posi Should](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6rxtBX3aO40yoC0wQYMq2y/2e726eee9e99a3b38e8695ec77b189e0/5JA2DJT9G9.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for daily texts to help you live your best life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nIf you really want to go scuba diving, best to say ‘I am going to learn to scuba dive.’ Then set your goal and take steps to achieve it.\n\n# Reframe those true 'shoulds.\nIt is easy for everyday chores like commuting to work or doing laundry to become drudgery. Remember that many less fortunate people don’t have food to eat, clothes to wear or a place to live. \n\nFocus on how lucky you are to have these things. By doing a reframe, you switch the energy from an experience of obligation to one of gratitude. Change ‘should’ to ‘I get to!’\n\n# Stop taking those guilt trips.\nHow many times do you do something that you ‘should’ so you can avoid feeling guilty? Do some digging and discover the real reasons for those guilty feelings. \n\n![Should Diet](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/VVckLTMT2o8isquWoAcAQ/4c44993f097fbd39d1016731bb9d1294/Screen_Shot_2016-09-05_at_5.27.08_PM.png)\n\nYou can then go to work dealing with those issues. In the meantime, have the courage to say ‘no’ and just sit with the guilt.\n\n# Face your fears.\nIf you find yourself saying ‘I should ask for a raise’ but you avoid asking because it brings up fear, it is time to be brave and ask. We all know that we must ask for what we want or we most likely won’t get it. People can’t read your mind. So ask and you shall receive – at the very least an answer.\n\n# Stop procrastinating.\nWe often use ’should’ to procrastinate and avoid doing something we really don’t want to do. In the event you are avoiding something like exercise, explore your resistance. Perhaps you are tired of the same old routine. Mix it up and try a tribal dance class. And remember the Nike slogan ‘Just Do It,’\n\n# Pare your to-do list.\nSometimes we just have too much on our plates. Yes, we are super heroines but even super heroines have their kryptonite. \n\n![Agenda](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/20dG64LS8smICiiMu4eEyI/a04de4c8bf290e7df88118aef017e325/HFH6U1U5T4.jpg)\n\nWe often do too much, give too much and lack strong boundaries.

Now I can't move forward. What am I gonna do?\" Or does your inner voice say, \"That's a bummer....but I can work through this\"?\n\nBelieve it or not, your beliefs and inner dialogue predict how well you overcome adversity. Stanford professor Carol Dweck's <a href=\"http://www.mindsetonline.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">fascinating research</a> on mindset finds that people who believe they have a fixed amount of intelligence or talent tend to give up easily when faced with a challenge, believing they've reached their limit. Those who believe their abilities can increase with knowledge and experience tend to display more tenacity in the face of a challenge, believing they can work at it until they find a solution. \n\nWhat does this mean for how you handle tough moments? \n\n# The limit does not exist. \n\nThere is mounting evidence that intelligence can change and improve throughout a person's life as they encounter opportunities to learn. \n\n![limit1](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/Ho2gDGOX4GwmOeAgmqWYe/8b7627b424368a24ff408ed66aab27da/limit1.jpeg)\n\nNew experiences create new neural pathways, which are reinforced by more experience. This process doesn't stop at any given point, meaning you can continue learning (and changing your brain) throughout your life. \n\n# Your self-talk sets you up to succeed or fail when faced with a challenge. \n\nSo if you've ever said, \"I'm stupid,\" or, \"I'm not smart enough to do X,\" stop it right now. Replace \"I can't\" with, \"I haven't figured this out ...yet.\" \"Yet\" leaves the door open for growth. If you just haven't figured something out yet, you can try new approaches, gather more information, and keep chipping away at the problem.  \n\n# There is so much opportunity in failure. \n\nIt's important to seek knowledge in every experience, especially failure.  I know failure doesn't feel good and may not be well received from others.  But you can't learn when you stay safe and only do what's easy. Think about an Olympic gymnast. Do you think she's doing the same skills and routines she learned at age five? Hardly. There were plenty of falls, injuries, and embarrassments she endured and overcame to get to the Big Stage. \n\n> When you fail, you learn what doesn't work. You learn about yourself, about the process you tried, about the people around you. \n\nNow, you can try again with far more knowledge and insight than when you began.\n\n# Stretch yourself. \n\nThere's no end date on when you can learn something new or push your intellect a bit farther. Try something you've always wanted to try and never tackled. What do you need to learn to be stronger in your professional life? \n\n![Stretch](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4OWMY28fOwI4GOWCsE4K8y/9a2e7e60a746f0c2f6b908b40e3e7594/stretch2.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com)for more advice daily via text.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nTake a class, attend a conference, or read about it.

Well, because I never imagined being here. By most accounts, I am not your everyday college professor. I did not spend years in a relentless pursuit of my position. Quite the opposite, in fact: I consider myself to be the accidental academic.\n\nIt sounds bizarre, but like so many young, Black males, in the 90s and now, I grew up with the misconception that playing professional sports was the only way to \"succeed.\" By the time I arrived at Rutgers University with a full ride to play Division 1 football, I had already picked out my three-piece suit for the NFL draft. A little premature, I know.\n\nI regret to say that I chose not to engage academically. Instead, I committed an array of academic improprieties, mentally crippling myself without even knowing it. Case and point: I didn’t read my first book in college, cover-to-cover, until my senior year. It was around that time that I realized the prospects of becoming a professional athlete were slim to none. A defensive back with a bum knee and little playing time under my belt, I just wasn’t good enough.\n\nForced to do something different, I started a personal renaissance of sorts. And as Audre Lorde powerfully wrote, \n\n> \"If I didn’t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people’s fantasies for me and eaten alive.\" \n\nThe problem was, I didn’t know who I was without sport. What was I good at? What and who did I want to be? How was I going to get there?\n\nBecause I didn’t know what do, my twenties became my blank canvas to try the different colors of life. I entered a master’s program, sold copy machines door to door in Los Angeles, was a doorman for the BET Awards After Party twice (I successfully avoided an unfavorable encounter with Suge Knight), worked in politics, acted in a later-cut scene of a music video, took the LSAT, tried modeling (with no success), interned for Congress, judged a beauty pageant, took the police exam for the LAPD and scored 98 percent, played neighborhood barber, and finally, gained admission into a doctoral program. Needless to say, these years were a bit all over the place.\n\n![vaughn1](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/15hSbKw0Lw48SukYaMYiIA/905e7794aa877824a10fc51b0c442dcc/vaughn1.jpg)\n\nBut you still might be wondering, how did I become a professor? Well, my desire to jump into anything and everything naturally calmed down over time, and I discovered that the life of a doctoral student doesn’t lend itself to very much outside of reading and writing. By the time I began writing my dissertation on the academic exploitation of the student-athlete, I was determined to become an athletic director and stop the exploitation of Black male student-athletes, similar to what I experienced. \n\nHowever, my dissertation advisor suggested that I give teaching a try, just about walking me into a class to guest lecture. I was kind of nervous. Okay, very nervous, but I got over it and spoke. Then, I did it again and again at other institutions. Before I knew it, I was interviewing to be a full-time assistant professor at a small liberal arts college outside of Boston. It’s now been four years since I started teaching, and I love it. So much that I think I just may stick with this for a bit, and leave my days as a salesman, doorman, model, music video actor, beauty pageant judge, and barber behind.\n\nI hope that for others who are equally unsure about their paths, mine serves as a reminder of three things:\n\n## 1. Embrace the road less traveled.\n\nOf course, there are suggested pathways to a career, but there is no one way. Our paths are just that: ours. They are a hodgepodge of trial and error, good advice, not so good advice, encounters with interesting people, unwavering hopes, crushing reality, and hopefully a little bit of fun. \n\n![Vaughn2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/74tpB1AGJOs82yIesGquuu/f33c8d4b4ed98e509f0954489c03e602/Vaughn2.jpg)\n\nNever compare your path with someone else’s, because once you dig past the surface level, you’ll discover no two are identical.\n\n## 2. Bet on yourself.\n\nThe notion of success is subjective, so there’s no reason to be crunched into other people’s definition of it. To find yourself and your success, you have to put yourself in a position for self-exploration. In other words, don’t be afraid to try something new because you are afraid. \n\nWhen I was offered admission into my doctoral program, I had a choice: Stay in my comfortable $65K a year job, or give up the money and bet on my future self. Many people, including my family, told me I was taking too huge of a risk, but I could not and would not listen. I took a cue from William Ernest Henley and decided that I was the master of my fate and captain of my soul.\n\n![Vaughn3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6O5kyh3iTuu4MUmCgsQUAA/664db4c3f901bac5ca3df9d5b343448b/Vaughn3.JPG)\n## 3. Establish a board of advisors.\n\nIn my late twenties, I realized that I had been playing the game of life without a coach or trusted mentor. I was operating under the the false impression that I could figure everything out myself. Sure, I was able to do okay, but I wanted to do better. That’s when my fraternity brother told me that, just as companies have boards of advisors, so should individuals. \n\nBoards are there to advise, vet, redirect, listen, and support the growth of company. If Fortune 500 companies are willing to seek sage advice, we should probably consider doing the same. \n\nAs they say, there is no time like the present to create your future. \n\n*<a href=\"http://thewell.jopwell.com/?utm_source=shinetext&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shine\" target=\"_blank\">The Well</a> is the editorial hub of <a href=\"https://www.jopwell.com/?utm_source=shinetext&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shine\" target=\"_blank\">Jopwell</a>, the diversity recruitment platform that connects Black, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American professionals and students with leading jobs and internships. \n*\n\n[READ NEXT: 4 Ways To Work Your Professional Network](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-work-your-professional-network/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"The Case For Embracing The Career You Didn't Plan To Have"},"slug":{"en-US":"the-case-for-embracing-the-career-you-didnt-plan-to-have"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Career","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5AZzJw76jmye8Ik06cqqu8/5216dc990e1c47ac414d5ccc7e01af4a/career.jpeg","details":{"size":5334383,"image":{"width":4500,"height":3112}},"fileName":"career.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-08-31T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Vaughn Calhoun","bio":"<p>Vaughn Calhoun, Ed.D, is the director of business programs and an assistant professor at Becker College.

The first year, I was on a high. My schedule was all mine. My practice was sustaining my expenses. I was making wonderful new friends. My clients were creating life-changing results. Life was good.\nLittle did I realize, I was relying heavily on an addiction I didn't even know I had: busy-ness. So much so, that in my second year, I broke down, crashed and burned out, hard. \n\n> I've since come to learn that this addiction was a manifestation of not-enoughness, or self-love, worth and value, rooted in the need for control and a lack of trust. \n\nWhat a gift that realization was. \n\nI knew my life had to change and I saw no other option than to sober up. Here are five ways I did so:  \n\n## I admitted to myself that I had a problem. \n\nI became fully aware of the addiction and exactly how it was impacting my life. \n\nPersonal time in my schedule was far and few between. The voice of fear became so loud in the calm, quiet moments. 'Will I survive? Will everything be OK?\" Busy-ness was comforting. I stole my own relaxation and created more stress.\n\n![busysub2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2hAVvR6deYAAmiC2i0OWqa/f98b82c3051b2013b12a48756fc1cc8c/busysub2.jpg)\n\nI wanted inspiration to write on my time. I expected specific results from projects. Who was I to think the sun wouldn't rise unless I set the alarm? Busy-ness was a manifestation of control. In doing so, I said, “No thank you,” to all the moments of magic and perfection the Universe had to offer me. \n\nI couldn’t treasure the fun memories I’d had with friends and family. I couldn’t fully experience the breakthrough moments with my clients. Busy-ness was the enemy of presence. I was so wrapped up in the worries of my mind that I was absent for the best times life had to offer.\nThere’s power in being able to fully understand the effects of your own behaviors. \n\nAsk yourself, “What is it costing me to stay exactly the same?” Recognizing these will help you to clearly see the problem, mounting more evidence for change. \n\n## I slowed down in my mind.\nThere were parts of my schedule that I simply could not change. Business had to proceed as usual. However, that voice of fear was getting rowdy. \n\n\"You can't relax right now!\" \n\n\"There 50 tasks waiting for your attention right now, why are you [slowing down](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/shine-squad-feature-ninas-4-tips-to-slow-down-and-enjoy-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)!?\"\n\n\"If you just do more, everything will be OK!\"\n\nTo calm fear down, I began to meditate—regularly. Even in the moments of life's nothingness, I have found that in sitting quietly and trusting, I am enough— I am doing enough—and everything is going to be okay.\n\nQuieting the mind of all it’s thoughts and fears can be done in many ways. I’ve since adopted practices of diaghragmatic breathing, yoga and regular prayer. \n\n## I stopped over-committing myself.\n\nThe people-pleasing habit is a problem that can be tough to break.\n\nI learned to dial up my f*%k-it meter and started saying “no” when I really wanted to say no. That was liberating. \n\nI practiced selfishness with my time and set up boundaries in my relationships. That was game-changing. \n\n![busysub](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2zhGtuFtw0qI04gK8w6iSy/6c45c63ddb08955a6c303bbe1107a76f/busysub.jpg)\n\nMake your opinion known at your next work meeting. Open clear lines of communication with your spouse or partner. Say ‘no’ to your friend’s party when you’re exhausted and just want to sleep. Learning to speak up when you have something to say—including ‘no’—is truly a practice in enoughness.\n\n## I slept (and quit my five o'clock a.m. workouts).\n\nProductivity decreases when you don't get enough sleep.  I knew this, but when I was engulfed by the voice of fear, it directed me otherwise.\nDrastic changes came with consistent rest. \n\nI've learned that loving my body and giving it what it needs is enoughness at its finest. I stopped exercising so hard and rescheduled workouts for later in the day. This felt good, really good. \n\nAll the while…\n\n## I learned to trust that doing less is Okay.  \nI searched for evidence that my life wasn’t going to come crashing down around me, if I didn't persist in working so hard to control it. \n\nAs I did, just the opposite happened. I learned inspired action yielded me ten times the results than fearful, controlling action does.\n\n![Less](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/z9ECQzrczYgCqsGmoEkmy/2a70ba831ab620e9cca4e3bd539d45b8/less.png)\n\nTrust is a practice. When you feel the inner turmoil of everyday anxiety arising, a simple mantra to repeat is, “Everything is going to be OK.” It’s a priceless tool. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I haven’t perfected recovery—I don’t believe that’s the point anyway.  This is one grand journey, one that I now have a deepened appreciation for.  \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Life Hacks For the Overcommitted\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-tips-for-the-overcommitted/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2016-08-30T08:00"},"author":{"name":"Maya Nahra","bio":"<p>Maya is a behavioral dietitian for frustrated, yo-yo dieters (people who already know what to do but just aren&#39;t doing it).

List all the debt you carry, and how much you owe each lender. See what kind of accounts are in your name, including any that your parents may have set up for you. Get a general look at the landscape before you go around trying to grow any roses.\n\n## __2. Open a savings account.__ \n\n __ Everyone needs to have a savings account.__ It’s a financial must. Even if you can only save $20 a month into it, you have to set one up. Often called an ‘Emergency Fund’, having a savings account that always has some cash in it will save your sanity if something goes wrong. \n  \nAim for $1000 to start with. You’ll get there in a year if you save $84 a month. $1000 is a really nice amount to have in case something goes wrong with your apartment or your car. And knowing you have that money there when you’ll need it will give you peace of mind. \n\n## __3. Focus on paying off your debt.__\n\nI graduated college with over $25,000 in debt. It feels terrible to carry that around every day, especially as you try to kick start your adult life. Every dollar you pay towards your debt takes you one step closer to freedom. The longer you carry debt, the more that someone else owns your life. \n\nYour money won’t truly be yours as long as you have to send X amount each month to your lender. \n\n![Money4](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/68sChW0L2EQcCQO6WokWMa/5c72c5f55501f59a3db145351a44c658/1FN7NK2P5B.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for a daily text with advice on how to live a happier life.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nCreate a plan to pay off your debt as quickly as possible. I’m debt-free today, and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I don’t stress out at night, wondering how I’ll make my payments, or how I’ll ever save any money. \n\n> Taking action will make you feel empowered, and watching the balance drop will make you feel strong.\n\nThese may seem like small things (OK, paying down debt isn’t small), but they will work wonders for your [happiness](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/five-easy-ways-to-be-happier-backed-by-science/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). Getting into a good groove with your money is one of the healthiest things you can do for yourself. It’s exactly like [running 5 miles a day](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)- just for your wallet. \n\nWhen you remove all those bad feelings about money, good ones will come rushing in. Learning about how to take control will make you feel like Wonder Woman. \n\nBy understanding your money situation, building up some savings, and paying down debt, you’ll be able to generate positive feelings towards your money. \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Simple Ways to Lighten Up When Things Feel Heavy](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"date":{"en-US":"2016-08-29T12:00"},"author":{"name":"Kara Perez","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.fromfrugaltofree.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kara Perez</a> graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A in English.

If you felt the stomach dropping, heart skipping clutch of fear at any point today, I'm guessing it wasn’t because you were zig zagging from a wild beast trying to maul you. \n\nYou were experiencing what I've dubbed MPTs or __Modern Protection Thoughts__ (acronyms are fun!) or for lack of better acronyms -- fear. \n\nFear is traditionally defined as \"an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat.\" We human beings take a lifetime of experiences and begin to (subconsciously) form the belief that fear is our best friend against pain and suffering, forming the Modern Protection Thoughts that shape each and every action that we take. \n\nThis pattern of thinking couldn't be more detrimental. \n\n# How Fear is Born\nThere's strong <a href=\"http://www.acestudy.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">evidence</a> that our earliest experiences as children shape our perspectives of the world for better and for worse. Children that experience abandonment, neglect, or different forms of abuse, are likely to use fear as a coping mechanism for dealing with the uncertainties that come in life. \nMy past experiences with an emotionally abusive father amped my MPTs / fears up like they took two shots of vodka and a Red Bull. \n\n![Fear4](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3mJZakv13GqoCii2ooeUqE/c66e53b07fe52c9beaa6450b3477966c/fear4.jpg)\n\nI was constantly on the subconscious hunt for signs and red flags from potential friends, lovers, job opportunities, you name it. I would use those \"signs\" to predict and project someone's future behavior and outcomes. \n\nThe downside of this pattern of thinking was that it wasn't always accurate. I couldn't control future outcomes based on this projection, so all it did was limit my connections with other people and experiences but not necessarily limit any pain. \n\n# 1. Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable\n<a href=\"http://www.brenebrown.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brene Brown</a>, a researcher and TED talk master, wrote a book based on her findings of what makes people happy and what role fear plays in our lives. She found that individuals who are able to be comfortable with vulnerability, take more risks in love, life, and career and benefit greatly from this habit of taking a chance on things that may or may not work out. \n\n> There will be plenty of times that you just cannot predict what the future will hold, and becoming OK with that fact is half the battle. \n\nOrganize your life based off of possibility, instead of limiting fears.\n\n# 2. Focus on the Facts \nFear is often based on projections of what could happen, and not what actually is occurring in the moment. \n\nTake a beat to step back and look at your current circumstances, and ask yourself the following: are your fears based in an immediate specific situation or are they figments of your imagination? What part of those immediate circumstances are you able to control and change? What parts are you not able to control, and are you able to let go of needing control of them for peace of mind? \n\nThere are times when we need to remember fears are a projection of the imagination and only have as much power as the mental energy we put behind them.\n\n# 3. Remember the Positive\n![Positive](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1gAuHGmVkS4AwkysC4mM0a/2f1a93eba19636c645024e696e78e176/8B74455531.jpg)\n\nBy remembering the positive things, no matter how small, in your life, you will be able to broaden your perspective and build the mental and physical resources to overcome your fears. Research shows that positive memories (also known as the broaden and build theory) boost your ability to have the energy to make changes or take control of unpleasant circumstances. The next time you feel yourself in a panic, stop and remember the things that are currently in your control that you are grateful for. \n\nWhen you use fear as your main lens of viewing the world, it creates a false sense of comfort and control. \n\nFear doesn’t guarantee you will avoid pain, and in fact, can cause more pain in the long run by limiting your experiences. Bad things happen to good people, even to people who have contingency plans B,C, D, first aid kits near their bed, and pay premiums for even the most obscure insurance policies. \n\n> When you're able to have a loving relationship with vulnerability, fact check the reality of your fears, and have a healthy dose of positivity, it will give you the freedom to be released from paralyzing fears. \n\nYou'll speak to that stranger on the bus, or start that company you've been yapping about for the past five years, or drop the word ratchet in a business meeting, because you'll be comfortable with the idea that it's ok to not be protected at all times.\n\nThat’s when you’ll begin to really start living.\n\n[READ NEXT: 4 Ways to Control Your Inner Control Freak\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"title":{"en-US":"3 Ways to Slay Your Fear (And Why We Worry)"},"slug":{"en-US":"3-ways-to-slay-your-fears-and-why-we-worry-so-much"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Fear","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/14ULliu2kIUGosWy0YSkE8/696cd3dd7c1176d61ebb70e8070af23f/fear3.jpg","details":{"size":531723,"image":{"width":1600,"height":700}},"fileName":"fear3.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"author":{"name":"Christina Blacken","bio":"<p>Christina Blacken is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.TheNewQuo.com\" target =\"_blank\">TheNewQuo.com</a> -- a platform for inspiration and insight from unconventional places. </p>\n","picture":{"title":"Christina Blacken","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1WQS8vz41OI2YEuQuOAIQu/00f70c3a2de860bf3f1176741089f2dc/194f0dc-1.jpg","details":{"size":25204,"image":{"width":337,"height":337}},"fileName":"194f0dc-1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"twitter":"cblacken"},"category":{"en-US":"LIFE"},"tags":{"en-US":["fear","stress","worry","fearless","scared","positivity","conquer"]},"description":{"en-US":"How to push through when your thoughts cause drama.

Being younger than everyone at my job has led me to constantly using phrases that confound my older colleagues, like “live-tweeting” and “hype.” \n\nI identify as a feminine-presenting, cis-gender female with a sunny, optimistic disposition. All of these characteristics have led to me being labeled “bubbly,” a “Disney Princess” and a “baby” in the workplace. \n\nI actually agree with all of these descriptions, but I am frustrated with the way co-workers treat me because of them. \n\n<center> ![Felicia](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5mdzudMpLaUCyuWkuwKUs4/66d10078a34b19021ca3874236ddac9e/Screen_Shot_2016-08-25_at_10.51.24_AM.png)</center>\n\nWe know there is gender-discrimination in the workplace. For generations, women have experienced sexual harassment, unfair lack of opportunities due to motherhood, and a terrifying wage gap that has women only earning 77 cents for every $1.00 earned by men, according to the 2014 Shriver Report. For women of color, it is even worse, <a href=\"http://www.now.org/resource/women-deserve-equal-pay-factsheet/African-American\" target=\"_blank\"> African-American </a> women are earning only 64 cents and Latinas only 55 cents.\n\nBut for this situation, I’m not even blaming just men. I’ve experienced situations where it felt like older women were taking advantage of me because they thought I was too nice and cheery to engage with conflict. It seems that people think women with ~a zest for life~ can’t also be ambitious or capable of handling large projects. How do you get them to take you seriously? \n\n> It is possible to be dancing and singing to a Beyonce song one minute, and effectively leading a strategy meeting the next. Or even both at the same time -- I’ve seen it done. \n\nSo, I’m a Disney Princess? Okay. They have their own badass moments, too. \n\nHere are seven tips on how to be taken seriously as a young, bubbly female:\n\n## 1. Keep a list of your accomplishments: \n\n![Journal](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6uqKycTfywYUESuCQE0a6u/12e8b974c620db75023fefba9a2dc19f/accomplishments.jpeg)\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up](https://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living you best life via text* </center>\n\n---\n  \nCreate a new system or process for your company? Make a note. Posted an Instagram photo with the highest engagement yet? Write it down. Organized the supply closet? Seal it in ink. Keeping a running list of personal achievements will help you see how many tangible solutions you’ve provided for your company and can be a visual reminder if you are questioning your value.\n\n## 2. Become an expert in your field: \nIf you’re feeling scared, uncomfortable or inferior when approaching a project, get ready to dive headfirst. Emmy-winning Viola Davis tweeted, “When in doubt, dive,” and if Viola Davis said it, I believe it. \n\nDon’t even know where to start? Tackle an intimidating project by breaking it up into smaller goals, and soon the pieces will show you how they all work together. This will help you go to project and strategy meetings prepared with facts, research, and questions. As you become an expert in your space, you’ll be the company’s go-to gal.\n\n\n## 3. Channel your inner straight, white cis-gender male:\n\n__This is problematic, I know. __\nWhile women shouldn’t have to act like men to establish a sense of power within the workplace, sometimes taking on the attitude of men helps us be less apologetic and more direct. \n\n> “Men are given opportunities based on their potential, and women are given opportunities based on their accomplishments.” -Lisa Kron, Tony-winning lyricist of Fun Home\n\nMake sure to stay savvy and up-to-date on what the competitive salary is for your position and industry. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for a large raise at your review (be ready with your list of accomplishments and quantitative data of your impact). Don’t apologize when offering suggestions and feedback. Present your ideas with enthusiasm. Be swift as the coursing river with all the force of a great typhoon a la Mulan.\n\n## 4. Reach out to older women in your industry:\n\n![Mentor](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6OCXCRhRfOCsQKC6SMwKIQ/52a6d205ad3408ca0cefb0b04467e392/mentor.jpeg)\n\nMaking connections and finding mentors will give you resources and access in your industry. You’ll have a go-to person for drinking pints and swapping all-too-familiar war stories, (“So man-splaining has always been a thing?”). \n\nYou can brainstorm and bounce ideas off of her and she can share solutions that worked for her. She can also introduce you to other women in the industry that you can learn from, too. \n\n## 5. Create a peer support network:\nWhile more established women in the industry can provide advice and perspective, it’s also important to gain insight from your peers. Women that have the same position across industries can be vital. They’ve probably experienced similar challenges and can help you reexamine yours in a new way to find a solution.\n\n## 6. Be aware of “off-days” and take time for self-care:\nI’ve found that having a bubbly personality means those around me expect me to be that way every day. That is not fair, nor realistic. You should be able to feel an array of emotions without feeling guilty of how that makes your co-workers feel. On these days that you don’t have rainbow glitter shooting out of your mouth, make time to reflect. Listen to your favorite music, drink water, journal about whatever is going on, and most importantly, don’t force yourself to be bubbly that day. \n\n## 7. Be Yourself: \nIf we learned anything from Elle Woods in Legally Blonde, it’s that the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance is not wetting your hair within 24 hours at the risk of deactivating the immonium thyglocoate and to be yourself. \n\nAll of her Harvard classmates were busy hating on her being a young, bubbly female, but she lived her truth of smiling, wearing bright pink amongst the dull neutral shades of Northeastern sweaters and being a kind person. She worked hard and showed them all how valuable Elle Woods could be. Your company hired YOU for a reason. \n\nShow ‘em why.\n\n[READ NEXT: Mind the Gap\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/mind-the-gap/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"author":{"name":"Felicia Fitzpatrick","bio":"<p><a href=\"https://feliciafitzpatrick.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Felicia Fitzpatrick</a> is the Social Media Manager for Playbill.

But a little introspection goes a long way and can give you a different point of view as well as insight to how you go about living your life. \n\nAs I approach 30 (next year!) my perspective as well as my priorities have changed. Now I would not wish that I tried to grow up so fast, however I do think there were some lessons that could accelerate my becoming my best self and using my time more wisely. \n\nBelow are a few things I would tell my myself in my early 20s to reduce the time it took to share my awesomeness with the world:\n\n---\n\n\n<center>*[Sign up](https://www.shinetext.com) for daily advice on living you best life via text* </center>\n\n---\n\n## You make the rules of your life.\n\nOne of the greatest things I’ve learned is that “you are the expert of you”. Harness that when you have to make the biggest decisions of your life. When you ask for outside perspectives, view others as “consultants”. \n\n> You are the “CEO” of your life and will make the final call - as well as reap the greatest effect. \n\nWhen you think about it you have the the ultimate directory of what make you you! What you were, what you wish to be and what you know in your heart you are - are all things that you are capable of determining.\n\n## You are valuable to the world to yourself and you do not have to compromise.\n\nThere is no one like you …NO ONE. Not with your experiences your view on the world, your desires no one in the world with your exact combination of unique abilities and value to share. So embrace it! \n\nEmbrace it nurture it and value it, because it will make you happy and secondly THAT is what changes the world being able to perfect what you and ONLY YOU can do. That is true magic. The world NEEDS your uniqueness.\n\n## Follow your gut. \n\n…especially if you have stress/anxiety pains.  Get in the habit of following your intuition.- Following your gut can be mental as well as physical. Do not ignore your body and if you think something is wrong you are most likely right. Go with your gut and respect your innate human/almost primal reaction to something that can cause you harm (in varied degrees).\n\n## Stress can change your DNA and shorten your life.\n\nBlue zones are places in the world where people live measurably longer lives than the rest of the world. The 3 factors that are usually at the root of their long lives are; levels of stress(or lack of), activity level and the foods that they eat. The connection between stress and our longevity is not as widely-discussed as food and activity level but it is just as important. \n\nIf you realize that you have a loss of energy around a certain group of people or doing a certain activity don’t ignore that feeling. Instead address it by eliminating that activity or group of people -- or by trying to reduce it significantly. Allowing stress to remain in your life is a form of self-abuse and it can reduce the number of years you have on this earth. One easy method of self care are taking 3 deep yoga breaths in the morning to center and start your day off right.\n\n## Health is wealth. Don't wait until it is gone before you appreciate it.\n\nWe are constantly reminded of the shortness of life and the various diseases or challenges that can make our lives a little more difficult. The root of these are frequently poor diet and bad habits. Whether it is our grandparents who only eat certain foods due to not being able to digest it, a friend from college that we see now has a terminal illness or an aunt who has adapted a healthier lifestyle and has a new vigor in living life. There are signs that show us how fragile our health is as well as that we have the power to change it. Are there ways that you wish you were healthier? Are there aspects to your daily life that you almost start to see as acceptable but you wish were not the case (aches and pains, being tired)? Be curious enough to get to the root of it and don’t accept bad health as a norm. Understand that your health will spill into other areas of your life (like your relationships). You do not have to wait until something unfortunate happens or until you are older in order to make a change. Start practicing good habits now.\n\n## Time is your greatest asset.\n\n> You can make money back but you can not buy more time. \n\nUse it wisely fill it with those people and experiences that contribute to your growth as a person and really make happier and a better person and. This is a habit that will help you have fewer regrets as you approach your later years. One exercise is tracking what you do with each hour of the day and how it made you feel or how close you got to achieving a goal. Set a budget/plan around your time as you may do with your money. Because time is truly a limited resource.\n \n\n[READ NEXT: Kristen Bell’s 5 Tips for Self-Care in 2017\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/kristen-bell-5-simple-tips-for-self-care/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":""},"priorityScore":{"en-US":5},"id":"7rLryDyr0keSakcSuKUwMo","urlPath":"articles/6-life-lessons-id-tell-my-younger-self/"},{"title":{"en-US":"How to Find Wisdom in Feeling Worthless"},"slug":{"en-US":"how-to-find-wisdom-in-feeling-worthless"},"body":{"en-US":"To gain a sense of self-worth, I relied on others for more than 20 years.

It got stronger. \n\n> When I realized that depending on others for my self-worth wasn’t working, I began to assert myself and set clear boundaries with my time and energy. \n\nAnd I’ve felt more worthy than ever!\n\nIt's important to recognize when a belief in your own worthlessness may be harming you and your relationships. With the right tools, you can shift from feeling worthless to feeling worthy, so that you can give and receive the utmost value in all areas of life. \n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com) for more life advice daily.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## 1- __Warning Sign__: You're prone to overworking in order to feel worthy.\n\n  __Guideline for Healing__: Busyness can become an addiction when we associate it with being worthy. You may feel burned out, yet unable to stop working more and working harder because of the temporary high of feeling valuable.\n\n  Pause, take a few deep breaths, and tell yourself that you’re worthy just the way you are. Repeat this often, especially if you don’t believe it (yet).\n\n## 2 - __Warning Sign__: You devote yourself to serving others in order to prove your own worth.\n\n  __Guideline for Healing__: The need to feel valuable is part of being human. Yet, serving others in exchange for self-worth actually prevents us from building an intrinsic sense of value and relating authentically to others.\n\n  Sufi poet and mystic Rumi advised: \"Never give from the depths of your well. Always give from your overflow.\" In other words, you serve yourself and others best not when you're struggling, but when you're fulfilled. Focusing on your own fulfillment lets you give and receive value in a healthy way.\n\n## 3- __Warning Sign__: You play a submissive role in your intimate relationships. \n\n  __Guideline for Healing__: You may find that you resist expressing your own wants, needs and beliefs within your relationships due to a sense of guilt, blame, or shame. As a result, you defer to others at the expense of your own well-being. \n\n  Allow yourself the time and space to listen to your bodily signals: they'll tell you what serves you and what doesn't. Do you feel pleasure and expansiveness in response to a given relationship or interaction? Likely, it's serving you well. Or, do you feel hurt or weighed down? Assess whether the situation is right for you and decide what needs to change. \n\nHow are you experiencing the warning signs of worthlessness in your own life? Are you learning to value yourself—and if so, how? As you recover and strengthen your self-worth, have patience: progress is an imperfect process. Worthlessness is a deep-rooted issue that takes even deeper love, care, and attention to uproot.\n\nTrust yourself and remember: You’re worthy just the way you are. Even if you don’t believe it (yet). \n\n[READ NEXT: I'm Good With Whatever: The High Price of People Pleasing](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/im-good-with-whatever-the-high-price-of-people-pleasing/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"Worth2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6v1e6RhZvOGKOwugoaE6UI/6a73a1cd4aa71a4f4aca9986a9bc7d1d/worth2.jpeg","details":{"size":3563790,"image":{"width":7359,"height":4798}},"fileName":"worth2.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"date":{"en-US":"2016-08-23T23:00"},"author":{"name":"Alana Helapitage","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ASharedPathAH.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alana Helapitage</a> is a writer and speaker who has helped female entrepreneurs tell their stories online, in print, and in person since 2014.

I joined The New Republic as the VP of Marketing & Communications in early 2015, and this June I launched Tactile, an agency that helps companies of all sizes create a more inclusive workplace for female leaders.\n\nIt’s been incredible, but with two full-time jobs, I have to put many aspects of my daily routine under a microscope. \n\nEvery morning, I walk about 15 minutes to the Q train, and then squeeze myself onto the subway like a sardine. As a born and bred New Yorker, I have always accepted morning insanity as a part of my existence. \n\nIn a way, having an annoying morning commute is almost like a sense of pride or badge of honor. But recently, I have decided that I need to transform this critical hour into a time of positivity and productivity, instead of sneering at advertising with misogynistic undertones while getting pushed. \n\n> As Amy Rothbard recently discussed in the Harvard Business Review, your morning mood affects your entire work day. \n\nHere are three ways to make the morning commute a positive start to the day. \n\n## 1. Treat Yourself\n\nLet’s face it, there are frequent hiccups to the morning commute, like trains getting delayed or re-routed. And if you are a coffee addict like most, that frustration may be exacerbated if you are still feeling like a zombie. \n\nSo, whether you make your coffee, buy your coffee, or decide to nix the coffee in favor of a juice (or donut), bring your treat with you for the morning commute. It will bring you a bit of happiness, even if you are standing on a hot subway platform for 15 minutes. \n\n![Commute3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3YoEgHYv2oYqq6UeW00aYO/a0e003ff049980ff9959721f56ca31f2/commute2.jpg)\n\n## 2. Find Your Podcast Soulmate\n\nThere is so much media we can consume these days, and I know that newsletters are all the rage for AM reading, but I believe podcasts make the perfect morning companion. \n\nIt allows you to be stimulated and entertained, without being too connected to your device to notice your surroundings. \n\nFind a podcast you love, subscribe to it, and listen to it on your way to work while you sip your coffee. For me, my morning podcast loves are Keeping it 1600, 2 Dope Queens, and forever and always This American Life. \n\n## 3. Establish Your Goals\n\nI am a big fan of squeezing as much productivity into the morning as possible. I recently changed the way I make “to do” lists. Before I create a list, I come up with my big picture goals for the day (and if it’s a Monday, I also do that for the week.) \n\nThis allows me to build my list of tactics with results in mind. The goals list is the perfect commuting task. Essentially, you just need to think big-picture about what you want to accomplish. For example two goals for me could be “Book a meeting for my agency with a potential client and close a content partnership deal for TNR.”\n\nThese steps may not erase sexist advertising from the subways, or encourage the able bodied man sitting to GET UP while a pregnant woman stands in front of him. But, these steps will hopefully make the mornings more positive so that you can have a better, more productive work day. \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Your 'Me-Time' Back\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":false},"description":{"en-US":"The 3 ways to make the dreaded commute, productive.

After all, when’s the last time you made a decision you regretted while doing so?  The danger of not listening to your gut, on the other hand, is something we can all relate to from personal experience.  Despite this, we sometimes ignore our instincts because, as Albert Einstein once pointed out,\n\n> “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.”  \n\nIt’s time we value the power of our gut instincts more, and actively work to connect with them to improve our lives.\n\nTrusting your gut doesn’t mean ignoring reason; it just means allowing yourself access to more information before making a decision.  There are two types of memory in the brain, [explicit and implicit](http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html).  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/memory/types-of-memory/explicit-memory\" target=\"_blank\"> Explicit memory </a> requires work for the brain to store (like knowledge you acquire while studying for an exam), while <a href=\"http://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/memory/types-of-memory/implicit-memory\" target=\"_blank\">implicit </a> memory flows effortlessly (like remembering a song lyric or knowing not to touch a hot stove).  In order to make great decisions in life, we need to be sure not to disregard our implicit memory, as this is what empowers our gut instincts to guide us in the right direction.\n\nHere are three strategies I recommend to help you tune into your inner truth and empower your decision-making.\n\nHere are 3 sure-fire ways to tap into your instincts:\n\n## 1. Free Your Mind\n“We need to create space to listen to what our gut is saying,” professor of human behavior Melody Wilding advises.  Hopefully, you’ve already incorporated some type of ‘free space’ into your daily routine; this could mean practicing traditional meditation or any other activity in which your mind, body and spirit are free and clear of distractions (e.g. running, walking, yoga).  Studies have shown that <a href\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-17693/18-ways-to-strengthen-your-intuition.html\" target=\"_blank\"> repetitive movements </a> also have a way of calming the cognitive mind and opening our intuition.  So whether it’s meditation, a sport, chopping vegetables or simply standing in the shower – take time to do something that allows your mind to drift freely. \n\n\n\n## 2. Reflect on When It Worked  \n\nTake a moment and think about instances when you’ve listened to your gut and it has paid off.  Use these positive experiences to instill confidence in your ability to trust your natural instincts.  If it is helpful, also consider past experiences when you’ve disregarded your instincts and later regretted it.  \n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for more life advice daily.* </center>\n\n---\n\n## 3. Set a deadline.  \n\nAs important as it is to free your mind, you also need to set a clear time frame for making important decisions.  It shouldn’t take long (less than an hour) to <a href=\"http://unreasonable.is/listening-to-your-gut-lets-give-it-the-credit-it-deserves/\" target=\"_blank\"> come to a decision </a> once you have all of the relevant information.  Imposing a deadline will eliminate the risk of overanalyzing things and will help you avoid being misguided by the ‘noise’ around you.  \n\n> “Don’t out-smart your initial gut reaction.  Don’t let your rational mind out-think your raw intuition.”\n\n__The Good News__:  The more we practice tapping into and trusting our gut instincts, the stronger their power becomes and the more willing we are to defer to them. “Your gut just gets better at doing what’s right for you.”  \n\n[READ NEXT: 6 Life-Lessons I'd Tell My Younger Self\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/6-life-lessons-id-tell-my-younger-self/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":"Trusting your gut doesn't mean ignoring reason; it just means allowing yourself access to more information before making a decision."},"priorityScore":{"en-US":2},"id":"2iazzMJwJqKMqM4y4i68KS","urlPath":"articles/the-hidden-power-of-trusting-your-gut-no-matter-what/"},{"title":{"en-US":"3 Things You Should Know About Intersectionality and Self-Care"},"slug":{"en-US":"3-things-you-should-know-about-intersectionality-and-self-care"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"selfcare3","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3EOCxW5ch2i8EOc8kccymI/249342483248025a9e640c1ce284c0fc/selfcare3.jpeg","details":{"size":4160114,"image":{"width":5472,"height":3648}},"fileName":"selfcare3.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["self-care","intersectionality","diversity","community"]},"author":{"name":"Rex Leonowicz","bio":"<p>Rex Leonowicz is a trans/nonbinary/femme writer, poet, and visual/performing artist from Queens, NY.

Countless books, articles, seminars, and workshops address the topic across the U.S. Entire industries have created complex marketing strategies that speak to self-care to sell products.\n\nThe topic of self-care is more of a given in many workplaces, schools, and other institutions, where mention of mental health was (and still is, in some cases) taboo.\n\nIt’s a great gift that balance, healthy lifestyles, and stress management are becoming common imperatives, rather than written off as selfish, unnecessary, or unproductive. But, does everyone have equal access to the tenets and practices of self-care? And, is the way we define self-care inclusive of all people-- those with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities? Who gets to practice self-care? \n\nBefore exploring these questions, it’s important to define what self-care means. \n\n<a href\"http://www.melissafabello.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Melissa A. Fabello </a> of Everyday Feminism <a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/self-care-101/\" target=\"_blank\"> defines self-care</a> as “any set of practices that makes you feel nourished, whether that’s physically, emotionally, spiritually, all of the above.” With this in mind, there cannot be one blanket strategy for practicing self-care. Different people require different tactics to maintain their personal well-being. For some, self-care might mean getting out with friends to let loose and dance. For others, it might mean cuddling up alone with a chill book at home. Common activities widely-associated with self-care include yoga, meditation, exercise classes, crafting, etc. \n\n> Self-care requires a whole slew of activities and strategies that allow people to center themselves, regroup, and address a variety of stressors. \n\n---\n<center> *For more ways to practice self-care, [sign up for Shine.](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n\nOkay, great, no problem! Sounds like something everyone can do, so what do access, definitions, and intersectionality have to do with self-care?\n\n__Now let’s define intersectionality. __\nIntersectionality is a concept that was articulated first by <a href=\"http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mapping-margins.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Kimberle Crenshaw </a>, and refers to how categories like race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability are interconnected and work together to affect our individual and collective experiences. The concept also explains how these categories correlate to different yet connected systems of oppression and privilege. \n\nOne main problem with self-care generally is it’s __based in a racialized and (cis)gendered middle class value system__ that often revolves around leisure, and an assumption of privileges that most people just do not have. \n\nIt also is based in a very narrow determination of what life is like, though most people’s lives don’t fit that bill. \n\nSelf-care is putting yourself first. Self-care is not taking work home with you. Self-care is treating yourself. Self-care means putting your worries aside. \n\nHow do you put yourself first if you’re a single parent working multiple jobs? How do you not take work home with you if your work revolves around social injustice, trauma, or inequalities? \n\n> How do you treat yourself if you’re living paycheck-to-paycheck? \n\nHow do you carve out leisure time if you’re chronically ill and shuffling from doctor’s appointment to appointment? How do you put your worries aside if you suffer from PTSD? \n\nSelf-care is often about addressing individual problems, without much mention to the structural and institutional influences that prevent our wellness in the first place. As <a href\"http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/component/k2/item/88-yashna-communities-of-care\" target=\"_blank\"> Yashna Padamsee</a> explains, “Oppression and trauma do influence our well-being. On-going generational trauma and violence affect our communities, our bodies, our hearts, minds and spirits.” \n\nWe have to transform the way we understand self-care because it doesn’t exist in a wormhole, where the effects of oppressions and privilege have no bearing on how we are able to care for ourselves. We have to redefine self-care so that it centers nuanced experiences, and seeks to challenge the ways oppressions affect our home lives, working lives, and recreational lives. We have to acknowledge that, as <a href=\"http://gutsmagazine.ca/blog/the-right-to-retreat-and-the-politics-of-self-care\" target=\"_blank\"> Rebecca Godderis and Joanna Brant</a> say, paraphrasing Audre Lorde, \n\n> “To preserve one’s self is an act of political warfare in a society where so many structures exist—sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, classism and so forth—that prevent all of us from being well, both physically and mentally.”\n\nOne way to do this is to ground self-care in an ethics of  intersectionality. Here are some ways we can practice self-care with intersectionality in mind: \n\n## 1. Understand the role oppressions play in our ability or inability to achieve wellness.\nRacism, transphobia, ableism, sexism, classism, etc. maintain barriers to self-care to the extent that marginal people often feel guilty for working toward it. Challenge whatever tells you that you don’t deserve your own healing. Also think about your privileges and the ways self-care has come naturally to you. \n\nEducate yourself and push for changes in self-care that are more inclusive and equitable.\n\n## 2. Seek out community care. \nCommunity care happens when we work toward our own self-care while also supporting the care of our peers, friends, family, and communities. \n\nFind and develop conscious networks of people to work toward personal and collective healing. Yashna Padamsee summed it up well when she said, “It is our responsibility not as individuals, but as communities to create structures in which self-care changes to community care. In which we are cared-for and able to care for others.”\n\n## 3. Practice your own brand of self-care with the strategies that make your body, heart, and spirit sing.\nYour version of self-care might look really different than what others do, and that’s okay.

But recollecting other memories, like an acne-ridden face, chunky braces and the bully who tipped over your books in the hallway, feels far less warm and fuzzy.\n\nAlthough your complexion has since cleared and teeth have straightened, sadly, bullies are just as prevalent today as adults as they were 15 years ago. Just trade the cafeteria for the water cooler and hand-written notes for passive-aggressive emails, and not much has changed.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"www.workplacebullying.org/wbiresearch/wbi-2014-us-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">research from the Workplace Bullying Institute</a>, nearly 27 percent of Americans have experienced or are currently experiencing some kind of bullying in the workplace. While there are varying levels of severity depending on the aggressor and his or her actions, when that bully is your boss, the stakes – and your emotional response – are heightened.\n\nMaybe your direct supervisor has inundated you with difficult work out-of-the-blue, and has no concern that you’re leaving the office once the lights turn out. Or maybe, you’re miffed from being continually passed over for new, challenging work and promotions.\n\n> Regardless of the wrongdoing, there’s one thing for certain: you absolutely, positively must do something about it.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean stomping into your supervisor’s office this second and offering her a piece of your mind. But it doesn’t mean slumping in your desk and simmering, either. You’ll need to approach your higher-up with a calm, collected demeanor and tactical game plan if you want to ensure a harmonious work environment and, most importantly, the growth of your career.\nHere are the seven most important steps to take before approaching a bully boss.\n\n## 1. Are you in danger?\n\nWhile bullying (in any shape or form) is unacceptable, if you feel as though you are in danger or becoming hurt, tell a trusted friend, family member of confidante and leave the situation now.\n\n## 2. Decide early on what you want to accomplish.\n\nNot all resolutions end in fireworks. If you feel as though nothing good will come of approaching your boss, it’s 100% okay to consider leaving your position. Workplaces are oftentimes riddled with difficult politics and hierarchies, which can make a bullying predicament difficult to overcome. While you search for a new job, try to remove yourself the situation as best as you can and lean on other coworkers/confidantes for support.\n\nOf course, if you believe that directly confronting your boss will bear the best results, there’s actually evidence to support your action. According to research from [EHS Today](http://ehstoday.com/health/when-bosses-are-bullies-fight-back), individuals who approached a hostile boss reported higher levels of personal satisfaction at work, removed from feeling like a ‘victim.’\nRegardless of your method for coping, ensure you know exactly what you want before diving in headfirst.\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up] (http://www.shinetext.com)for more life advice.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Start writing everything – meaning everything – down.\n\nIn the event you will approach your bullying boss, you’ll need to start writing every interaction or instance of bullying down. And we mean everything.\n\nWhether it was a demeaning, condescending email or eighth consecutive night you left office after nine o’clock (while he left at five), make sure to log every action, no matter how seemingly insignificant.\nNo matter if it’s used to draft your speech once you approach your boss or to show your boss’s boss, build your case as meticulously as possible.\n\n## 4. Before outlining your next move, take a moment to step into her shoes.\n\nWhether it was Miranda Presley in The Devil Wears Prada or Dolly Parton’s superior in 9 to 5, totalitarian, ruthless bosses are a popular narrative in our culture. And while your gripes with your boss are certainly warranted, there might be an entirely different story you’re not aware of.\n\nIs your boss shoving piles of work on your desk because she is swimming in work as well, or is he still reeling from his divorce? You’ll still need to express your feelings to your supervisor, but try to remember, he or she is a person too. Refrain from pointing fingers until you know all the facts.\n\n## 5. Arrange a meeting (but prepare a game plan in advance).\n\nOnce you’ve assembled your ammo (factual evidence) and mustered up your courage, you’ll need to finally do the dreaded deed: schedule a time with your boss to talk.\n\nTry to pick a time when he or she will be the least overwhelmed, like in the morning earlier in the week. By Thursday or Friday, your boss might be less inclined to listen to your feelings, especially when they are seemingly negative about him or her.\nBefore you enter the room, know exactly what you will say – and what you want to come out of it. Do you want a promotion or a decreased workload? Ensure there’s an end goal, and your boss is made aware of it early on.\n\n## 6. Think positive.\n\nAlthough tempting to blurt out to your bully, statements like “I feel like you’re continually turning me down for raises” will get you nowhere. Instead, try to take the emotion out of your complaint and spin it in a positive light.\n\nFor example, try: “I’ve noticed that you have turned me down for three consecutive raises. Can you please explain to me why, and what aspects of my performance I can improve for the review period?”\n\n## 7. Continue to work hard, but know when enough is enough.\n\nOnce you’ve left the confrontation with your bully boss, things will undoubtedly be awkward for a bit. And of course, there will be a significant chance he or she will ignore your feelings and continue their bullying behavior.\n\nIf this is the case, know when enough is enough. Consider approaching your boss’s supervisor or HR. If that’s out of the question, there’s no shame in finding a new role – with a boss who will appreciate your talents and invest in your success.\n\n[READ NEXT: Why *JUST* Is the Most Unfair Word\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/why-just-is-the-most-unfair-word/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":""},"priorityScore":{"en-US":4},"id":"64iudoeCtOWiWqEaUoUiwY","urlPath":"articles/my-boss-the-bully-7-steps-for-dealing-with-demanding-higher-ups/"},{"title":{"en-US":"5 Tips for Night Owls with a Day Job"},"slug":{"en-US":"5-Tips-for-Night-Owls-with-a-Day-Job"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"nightowl2","description":"night, work","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/2mGOX59T4cgAoMm46uGqi6/f42afe8e58ba7bafff61157076d3afcd/nightowl2.jpg","details":{"size":80799,"image":{"width":890,"height":593}},"fileName":"nightowl2.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"Work"},"tags":{"en-US":["productivity","night owl","work","creativity"]},"author":{"name":"Taylor Henriquez","bio":"<p>Taylor Henriquez works in publicity for a LA ad agency.

My day job starts in less than 12 hours, and I am wide awake and ready to tackle the day (err... night). From 7:00 p.m. to midnight, I’m in my groove and at peak performance for getting important stuff done.\n\nMy name is Taylor Henriquez, and I’m a night owl working a 9 - 5 schedule. \n\nThere’s not much written about the <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/peter-economy/11-scientific-reasons-why-night-owls-get-more-done.html\" target=\"_blank\"> benefits of night productivity </a>. Instead, many articles cite the advantages of being an early riser, give tips for creating a productive morning routine, and provide examples of successful people who have  5:00 a.m. wake-up times. <a href \"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/what-you-can-learn-from-benjamin-franklins-daily-schedule.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Benjamin Franklin I am not </a>, and it has taken me years to acknowledge and accept that I’m not a morning person, and will probably never become one according to my circadian rhythm, no matter how many tips or hacks I try. \n\n![Nightowl1](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/28C25XjZny2Mk6aci8aiYI/6b2eb7ff85e0d70260d8d178352c3fd8/nightowl1.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://shinetext.com?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for Shine for free, daily motivational text messages* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhich brings me to my 9-5. Every Monday through Friday, I’m expected to be a fully functioning human by 9:00 a.m. This is not easy for me, but I’ve found a couple of tricks to help my traditional schedule work best for me and my team, without relying on three cups of coffee, two cans of Diet Coke in the afternoon, and a prayer to tackle work throughout the day. Below are five ways you can take advantage of your 9-5 schedule if you’re a night owl.  \n\n## 1. Write out your work to-do list first thing in the morning \nThe first thing I do when I get to work is make myself my first (and usually) my last cup of coffee for the day. The second thing I do is write out my work to-dos, followed by a quick scan of any important emails. Most productivity articles will tell you to start your day working on the most challenging assignment. I would not have a job if I had to do this. For me, tackling mundane administrative work is the best way to start my morning: little creativity and problem solving required. \n\n## 2. Tackle the hard stuff at night \n\nSo when do you get to the demanding assignments? Do it at night or at your peak afternoon hours, if possible. Granted, this will require some planning on your part to make sure deadlines are met, but tackling projects during a peak rather than a slump, can make all the difference in your work, taking it from good to great. Just refrain from sending out midnight emails to your team because you are on a roll. \n\n## 3. Take a break: nap, meditate or read\n\n![nightowl3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/HqoRbhWZwIcAom268sCsu/b6006c2195550d7f6c1b0c271bfb7c25/Screen_Shot_2016-07-28_at_11.49.35_AM.png)\n\nBy now, it’s widely known that taking a <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3049122/hit-the-ground-running/the-scientific-case-for-taking-a-two-hour-lunch-break\" target=\"_blank\"> lunch break can actually boost productivity </a> when you return. We all know that breaks are good for us, but no one wants to be the person who leaves every day for an hour to go to Panera Bread. Stop being a martyr. Take an actual break:  a break where you aren’t riding around looking for a sandwich, but one where thinking and reacting is kept to a minimum. \n\n## 4. Go out and network \nYour 9 - 5 is over, and while you could take the evening to catch up on your side hustle or finish work, you could also use this time and newfound energy to network and go out to industry events to build connections. You know what your colleagues are doing after work? Passed out on the couch watching Netflix. \n\n## 5. Prepare for your day the night before \n\nMornings aren’t so dreadful when you’ve prepared the night before. For me, that means showering before bed, picking out my outfit, prepping lunch, and packing my bag. Now if I could only remember my keys. \n\n[READ NEXT: 5 Productivity Hacks to Get Your 'Me-Time' Back\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":""},"priorityScore":{"en-US":6},"id":"LZXXSkyMCqoeEOgY0MUUa","urlPath":"articles/5-Tips-for-Night-Owls-with-a-Day-Job/"},{"title":{"en-US":"The Importance of a Daily Routine"},"slug":{"en-US":"the-importance-of-a-daily-routine"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"routine1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/1qQFd5IiLikU2WoeEO2IiI/0ddbfb6362d96da61e4c0e129dae9ced/routine1.jpeg","details":{"size":960576,"image":{"width":5481,"height":4539}},"fileName":"routine1.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["productivity","exercise ","health","routine","bedtime","morning"]},"author":{"name":"Harper Spero","bio":"<p><a href=\"http://www.harperspero.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harper Spero</a> is a New York City based business and career transition coach who has found a way to integrate passion with purpose.

Just because a routine works for your friend or family member doesn’t mean it’s the best for you to take. Here are some tips to keep a daily routine:\n\n## Bedtime Habits:\n\n<a href=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5MMdwBq1e8ieQscus6Oi4q/3f0fe8716ca379a8fc208a25a5d65eab/importance-of-routines-001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/5MMdwBq1e8ieQscus6Oi4q/3f0fe8716ca379a8fc208a25a5d65eab/importance-of-routines-001.jpg\" alt=\"importance-of-routines-001\" style=\"max-height:100%\"></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for daily tips to improve your morning.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\nGo to bed and wake up each day around the same time. This is the first step to start a routine. By going to bed at the same time, you program your body to get into a ritual of sleeping a set number of hours. People have different sleep patterns that allow them to function throughout a day. When you feel energetic, studies suggest self-esteem rises. But feeling tired can have the opposite effect.\n\nIn order to fall asleep at night, strive to turn off all electronic devices (computers, phones, tablets) at least 30 minutes prior to getting into bed. Allow your eyes to relax and catch a break from the stimulation of a lit screen. Read a book, write in a journal, or write out your to-do list for the following day. By releasing your thoughts in writing, you can also release stress and tension and put your mind at ease.\n\nSet an alarm if you cannot wake up automatically at the same time [every morning](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-habits-for-a-blissful-morning-every-morning/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog). Consider adding a few drops of lavender essential oil to your pillow to relax and calm the mind before bed. Take a few deep breaths once you lay down to release tension. For some, white noise can also promote relaxation (not to mention help block out any outside distractions). There are noise machines available online and in stores, or there are free apps that play relaxing sounds including beach waves, rain, birds chirping, and more.\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning and want to feel energized and ready for the day, set an intention or goal for the day. Determine what it is you want to accomplish or feel throughout the day. A daily meditation practice, even if it is brief, can help us feel grounded, at-ease, and more prepared for the day. \n\nAccording to neuroscientists, <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/contemplation-therapy/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"> meditation physically changes the brain </a>. A MRI research study revealed that experienced meditators had a thicker cortex than non-meditators. This was particularly true for brain areas associated with attention, interoception, and sensory processing. Your practice can be two minutes or 20 minutes, whatever works best for you and your mind and body.\n\n## Eating Habits:\n\n<a href=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/yQ6Zt3d4mOaQOmIEWUQqU/3f938ebb1140c3520a0342c7858d5a0c/importance-of-routines-002.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/yQ6Zt3d4mOaQOmIEWUQqU/3f938ebb1140c3520a0342c7858d5a0c/importance-of-routines-002.jpg\" alt=\"importance-of-routines-002\"></a>\n\nBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. Holistic health coach Tracey Lemle says an eating routine shouldn’t be strict or like you’re being forced to do something. “Our bodies respond really well to repetition even when it comes to eating. It’s like muscle memory but for our stomachs,” she says. Once you wake up, drink a glass of water and try to incorporate protein into your breakfast. Protein helps us feel satisfied throughout the day. Consider oatmeal or quinoa with bananas, almonds, and a little honey for a healthy, easy, low-cost start to your day.\n\n## Exercise Habits:\n\n<a href=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/54pVlDI8iQYkaqW0couGY0/631fc03f417601e009f11ceefb4e327b/importance-of-routines-003.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/54pVlDI8iQYkaqW0couGY0/631fc03f417601e009f11ceefb4e327b/importance-of-routines-003.jpg\" alt=\"importance-of-routines-003\"></a>\n\nMake it your goal to move in some way every day. Physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic disease, improve balance and coordination, aid weight loss, and improve sleep habits and self-esteem. One in four Americans don’t get any exercise at all. But when persistently tired people exercised for just 20 minutes a day, three days a week for six weeks, they felt they had an increase in energy.\n\nDesign a program that works best for you. For some people that means taking a 60-minute fitness class four times a week. For others it’s a long run twice a week, and for others it’s a daily walk with friends. Try out different studios, teachers, classes, podcasts, and apps to determine what suits you best. Whatever path you choose, just remember moving benefits your body.\n\n## Conclusion\nTake time for yourself and keep a routine in your sleep, eating, and exercise. These are three crucial rules for living a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Remember, this is your life and you have to do it the way that works best for you.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.northwestpharmacy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> NorthwestPharmacy.com </a>.\n\n[READ NEXT: 10 Habits for a Blissful Morning, Every Morning](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/10-habits-for-a-blissful-morning-every-morning/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":"These tips will help you keep to a daily routine.

We had computers, but we mostly just used them to play Oregon Trail or The Sims. Myspace changed everything. Suddenly there was this pressure: Were you popular enough (i.e. Did your page make you look cool enough to be in someone’s “Top 8”)?\n\nThis also really marked the first time regular people connected with celebrities; suddenly you might “know” someone linked to a famous singer or actor, and your connection could be apparent to others and elevate your own status. This is also when the word “friend” began to lose its currency. We started calling everyone – even people we’d never met before – a “friend.”\n\nIt was actually a huge relief when Facebook first came along. Every profile looked the same, so you no longer had to worry as much about being outdone or staying relevant. Of course, the one-upmanship did eventually trickle down, though. As Facebook’s features evolved, so too did the opportunity to curate and share perfect-looking lives. One example that comes up a lot: We all have friends who we hang out with offline, and sometimes we’re privy to things like when one of them is going through a hard time. So when that same friend posts, “Everything is really good! #mybreakfast #hummus #kale” on Instagram, you’re thinking, ‘Wait a minute … You were on my floor last night saying you couldn’t go on.’\n\nI understand why most people don’t want to broadcast their failures alongside that photo of them in Napa taken with really flattering lighting. But as viewers, we need to understand what we’re looking at. It’s important to recognize that so much of what we share on social media — from our profile pictures to our bios — has been put through a filter. There’s this big disconnect between what we think other people are accomplishing and what’s real. It can make us feel uncomfortable with our own achievements and force us to question whether we’re “successful” enough. \n\n> There’s always something else to covet or someone else’s perfect moment to envy. It can be a very unhappy way to live.\n\n[As social media has evolved](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-social-media-can-boost-your-confidence/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), so has the need for us to understand what we’re looking at through everyone’s filters. We have a hard time distinguishing between our perception vs. reality. \n\nHere are a few understandings I like to come back to in order to keep moving forward.\n\n![azure2](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/3xp2Edw5FK0oo0ukQU2UY/5a4db38115c070896bbac230de7270af/azure2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n<center>*For more advice, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/ ?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily messages from Shine.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n## 1. You are enough.\n\nWhen we’re constantly being flooded with other people’s highlight reels, we start to feel like our own accomplishments aren’t enough. They are. I’ve been running a startup for the last two years, and it has been among the most humbling and hardest things I’ve ever done. \n\nSometimes people will say to me, “You’re such an inspiration.” While I want to be emotionally healthy enough to say “thank you” and move on, I actually feel nervous. I can’t help but think about all of my pitfalls and the many mistakes I’ve made. \n\nI wonder what they would think if they knew about those things. When you are in a position where you are constantly being evaluated, you start questioning so many things – even things like your integrity and your morals that you know in your own heart to be true. Know that it’s OK to question yourself and have doubts. Acknowledge them, but then keep plugging. That’s how you will continue to grow. \n\n## 2. Just because people don’t broadcast their struggles doesn’t mean they don’t have them.\n\nDon’t measure the success of whatever you’re doing against how your peers are doing. If I am using my peers’ success as the standard gauge of success for my own business, I am failing. \n\nSince people tend to mostly share their highlight reels and success stories — except for maybe a one-off story about a challenge they faced way back when that they are bringing up after the fact to demonstrate how far they’ve come. We have to remember that people aren’t necessarily talking about [all the hard stuff](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-things-to-tell-yourself-in-tough-moments/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) that happens on the way to being successful. \n\n![azure3](//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/4R9aYh3Itqk8ymc04oiEKe/5a4db38115c070896bbac230de7270af/azure3.JPG)\n\n---\n\n<center>*[Sign up](http://www.shinetext.com) for daily inspiration via text.* </center>\n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Our stories don’t just start and end.\n\nNo one talks about Henry Ford filing bankruptcy a bunch of times before making it, but those are the stories we really need to keep us going when we start doubting ourselves. Someone’s story could start with “I’m homeless and living in my car” and turn into “I won a Grammy” or “I went public with my company” – huge and extreme things like that. \n\nThat’s why, whenever I start to panic because I’m not where I thought I was going to be at this point in my life, I remind myself that my story’s not over. I’m still in the middle of it, and that means a lot of success (and failure!) is still ahead of me. \n\n## 4. Wherever you are is exactly where you’re meant to be.\n\nEvery day, I tell myself, “There is no need to hurry. You are not late. Whatever is yours will be yours. No one can steal your opportunity because it doesn’t belong to them. Wherever you are is exactly where you’re meant to be.” As we journey through our careers and our lives, we can expect there to be roadblocks and challenges, along with hopefully some great “wins” and rewards. \n\nWe can’t anticipate what exactly is going to happen, but we can control how we react to where we are, even when we haven’t met our own expectations or don’t feel as satisfied as our newsfeeds suggest. I love what Winston Churchill said about success – that it is “just going from one failure to another without losing momentum.” \n\nI think we can all manage that.\n\n[READ NEXT: 6 \"Shoulds\" to Abandon Right Now](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/6-shoulds-to-abandon-right-now/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":""},"priorityScore":{"en-US":8},"id":"7cJ7tO8HFmywKIwqmUcwkW","urlPath":"articles/wherever-you-are-is-exactly-where-you-need-to-be/"},{"title":{"en-US":"4 Ways Fitness Can Transform Your Mental Health"},"slug":{"en-US":"4-Ways-Fitness-Can-Transform-Your-Mental-Health"},"headerPhoto":{"title":"fitness","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6IjcXhShIQUiWwkqEgqACA/ebb01aca21ecd1c10d4ba0bbd4fbbdd3/fitness.jpeg","details":{"size":244322,"image":{"width":2048,"height":1365}},"fileName":"fitness.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"category":{"en-US":"Life"},"tags":{"en-US":["self-care","intersectionality","diversity","community"]},"author":{"name":"Kelsey Bishop","bio":"<p>Kelsey is a junior at Boston College studying Finance and Entrepreneurship.

Whether it’s because I’m out of breath walking up a lofty flight of stairs, or I’m having trouble keeping up with a friend during a morning jog, this recurring thought is more frequent than I’d like to admit. And this thought, whether I like it or not, is extremely damaging and dangerous.\n\n__Working out should be fun.__ It shouldn’t be a chore, or something that is forced. However, when I begin working out because I need to get into shape, it becomes a different story. Forcing yourself to [run for a hour](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) on the treadmill for the sole purpose of “being in shape” or “being skinny” is not the most healthy mindset. Though exercise is one of the best things you can do for yourself, the benefits you reap are far greater when you have a healthy mindset. \n\nA strong mentality behind the way we approach our physical health is so vital. In order to be in good shape physically, we must be in good shape mentally. \n\n> When fitness comes from a place of confidence, strength, and love for ourselves, we can get so much accomplished in our 20 minutes of cardio everyday. \n\n\n---\n\n\n<center> *For more advice, [sign up](http://shinetext.com/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) for free, daily texts from Shine.* </center>\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are 4 benefits *unrelated to your toned arms* to being physically active everyday:\n\n## 1. It’s a Stress Reliever\nGetting outside for a jog can be great for stress reduction. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a chemical that can moderate the brain’s response to stress. If you’re feeling overwhelmed at work, a little cardio could be the answer.\n\n## 2. You’ll Boost Your Brainpower\nVarious studies on mice and men have shown that cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance. Studies suggest that a tough workout increases levels of a brain-derived protein (known as BDNF) in the body, believed to help with decision making, higher thinking and learning. Say hello to a smarter you ;)\n\n## 3. You’ll Gain Self Confidence\nNeed a little [self love](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/becky-g-shares-how-self-love-helped-change-her-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)? Physical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive self-image. Give yourself the attention and care that you need and get yourself to the gym!\n\n## 4. You'll Maximize Your Productivity\nResearch shows that workers who take time for exercise on a regular basis are more productive and have more energy than their more sedentary peers. While busy schedules can make it tough to squeeze in a gym session during the work day, some experts believe that midday is the ideal time for a workout due to the body’s circadian rhythms. \n\nWe all love to feel in shape, but working out does more than that for us. By being physically active, we relieve stress, boost brain power, improve [self confidence](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/3-ways-to-take-back-your-confidence/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), and increase our productivity. \n\nGet moving!\n\n[READ NEXT: How Running Became My Best Therapy\n](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/)\n\n<div class=\"pubexchange_module\" id=\"pubexchange_below_content\" data-pubexchange-module-id=\"2323\"></div>\n\n<script>(function(w, d, s, id) {\n  w.PUBX=w.PUBX || {pub: \"shine_text\", discover: false, lazy: true};\n  var js, pjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async = true;\n  js.src = \"//main.pubexchange.com/loader.min.js\";\n  pjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, pjs);\n}(window, document, \"script\", \"pubexchange-jssdk\"));</script>\n"},"promoted":{"en-US":true},"featured":{"en-US":true},"description":{"en-US":""},"priorityScore":{"en-US":9},"id":"3AcO8YTYwUCmgmoySSaGYM","urlPath":"articles/4-Ways-Fitness-Can-Transform-Your-Mental-Health/"}]
